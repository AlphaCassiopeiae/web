            <h2>Project Name: Î±Cassiopeiae 8800</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Functional Description:</h2> We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. Our product is designed to appeal to hobbyists and educators interested in low-level computer programming, targeting these specific markets. Unlike other Altair 8800 clones and low-level programming interfaces, our product stands out by offering a compact, portable, and physical interface that authentically represents early computer technology. Furthermore, it supports ongoing learning through the potential for expansion cards and software development. 
			<br/><br/>
			The replica will aim to maintain the functional structure of the original computer which includes an enclosure that has a front panel with switches and LEDs as a programming interface, and individual CPU and memory cards that will slot into a common backplane, which acts as an 8080-derived bus in the vein of the S-100. We will utilize the RP2350B microcontroller to emulate the functionality of the original Intel 8080 processor on the CPU card. If time permits, a UART card will be developed to enable our computer to do high speed serial interfacing. Our team will be designing each of the front, backplane, and card PCBs; the interfaces for the S-100 bus; a buck converter for power delivery; and software to emulate the Intel 8080.  
            
            <h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2></b>  
                <ol>
                    <li>PSDR #1: (Software) An ability to emulate the Intel 8080 processor as a device with internal states, and which is tied to the external clock/single-step on the 8080-bus.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #2: (Hardware) An ability to communicate between the various sub-components (cards, front panel) using an S-100-inspired 8080 bus protocol, implemented via RP2350 PIO.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #3: (Hardware) An ability to interface with the user via front panel display (red LEDs) and switches (slide switches and tactile buttons), allowing the user to control the clock/single-step and 8080 bus signals. </li>
                    <li>PSDR #4: (Hardware) An ability to supply 3.3/5V power from the backplane PCB to all the various components of the device using an integrated step-down power supply (buck conversion) from a reference design. </li>
                    <li>PSDR #5: (Hardware) An ability to interface all electronic and hardware components together in a hybrid enclosure design, where the front panel PCB, acts as a front panel for the enclosure, the backplane correctly interfaces with the tray slots in the enclosure, and all edge board and FFC connectors function correctly. </li>
					<li>PSDR Stretch: (Hardware) An ability to perform serial bi-directional communication via an additional UART card, allowing for the use of monitor programs such as Microsoft BASIC.</li>
