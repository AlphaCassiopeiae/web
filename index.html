            <h2>Project Name:  AlphaCas 8800</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Functional Description:</h2> We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. Our product is designed to appeal to hobbyists and educators interested in low-level computer programming, targeting these specific markets. Unlike other Altair 8800 clones and low-level programming interfaces, our product stands out by offering a compact, portable, and physical interface that authentically represents early computer technology. Furthermore, it supports ongoing learning through the potential for expansion cards and software development. 
			<br/><br/>
			The replica will aim to maintain the functional structure of the original computer which includes an enclosure that has a front panel with switches and LEDs as a programming interface, and individual CPU and memory cards that will slot into a common backplane, which acts as an 8080-derived bus in the vein of the S-100. We will utilize the RP2350B microcontroller to emulate the functionality of the original Intel 8080 processor on the CPU card. If time permits, a UART card will be developed to enable our computer to do high speed serial interfacing. Our team will be designing each of the front, backplane, and card PCBs; the interfaces for the S-100 bus; a buck converter for power delivery; and software to emulate the Intel 8080.  
            
            <h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2></b>  
                <ol>
                    <li>PSDR #1 (Hardware):  Design and implementation of mechanical constraints of various PCB connections. (i.e. Front Panel to Enclosure, Front Panel to Backplane, Backplane to Card) </li>
                    <li>PSDR #2 (Hardware): Design and Implementation of front panel user interface, its connection to the card backplane, and clock/bus control protocol.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #3 (Hardware): Design and implementation of a backplane integrated step-down power supply (buck conversion) from a reference design to supply 3.3/5V power.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #4 (Hardware/Software): Design and implementation of S-100-inspired 8080 bus protocol via RP2350 PIO (Master and Slave)</li>
                    <li>PSDR #5 (Software): Design and Implementation of 8080 emulator for use on a microcontroller with support for external clock.</li>
					<li>PSDR Stretch (Hardware/Software): Design and implementation of a UART card that allows for bi-directional communication to/from backplane bus to UART serial, allowing for the use of monitor programs.</li>
