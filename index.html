					<h2>Project Name: αCassiopeiae 8800</h2>
					<h2>Project Functional Description:</h2>
					<p>We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. The user interface for this device is a front panel with control switches and LEDs. This device in its complete form will provide the following functionality:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The front panel will provide the ability to write programs to run on the machine using the front panel. The front panel will provide switches and LEDs such that the user can interact with memory, this way users can read and write Intel 8080 instructions to/from memory to be executed by the CPU card.</li>
						<li>The user should be able to add optional expansion cards to allow more advanced functionality, for example, communication over UART. These cards will be extremely similar to the CPU and memory cards, so they will simply plug into the backplane PCB using DDR4 DIMM connectors. 
							The user should be able to add/remove these optional cards to achieve the functionality they desire. For our project, we plan on providing a working UART card with custom firmware.</li>
						<li>Our machine will also be wall-powered, such that the user simply needs to plug it into a standard 120V wall outlet to power the machine. We plan to run all of our components on 3.3V, so we will need to implement some simple step-down voltage regulation to ensure the safety of our components. </li>
					</ol>
					
					<br><br>
					<h2>Components</h2>
					<br>
					<h1>Front Panel</h1>
					<p>The front panel will make up the user interface of our design. It will use LEDs to display information to the user, and that will consist of 8 status lights, 16 address bit lights, and 8 data bit lights. 
					In terms of user control, the front panel will provide various slide switches for CPU control, memory examination, and reset functions. These will mostly be slide switches to mimic the original Altair, and these switches will connect directly to the CPU card, and the CPU card will communicate on the bus to write values to memory as needed.
					The clock generation will also be on the front panel, and will use switches/buttons to allow normal clock operation (2 MHz) and support single-step clock. </p>

					<br>
					<h1>Internal Cards</h1>
					<p>The enclosure houses a backplane PCB with 5 DDR4 DIMM connectors for functionality cards. These cards include CPU, memory, and UART cards, all based on the RP2350 microcontroller. All of these cards will have roughly the same layout, with the firmware/software driving the microcontrollers differentiating the functionality.
					These cards must be able to operate on the bus, which is heavily inspired by the original S100 bus used in the Altair. With the exception of the CPU and memory cards, the user should be able to add/remove the UART card if they want that functionality or not.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h1>Backplane PCB</h1>
					<p>The backplane PCB will be the motherboard for our system, and it will use 5 DDR4 DIMM connectors to connect to the CPU, memory, and UART cards. The traces connecting the DDR4 connectors will support our bus implementation, which will be driven by the microcontrollers on the CPU/memory/UART cards using the Programmable IO feature of the RP2350.
					The bus we're implementing is heavily inspired by the S100 bus used for the original Altair. The S100 bus used 100 pin connectors and some exotic voltage levels, including 8V, +/-16V, as well as +/-5V. We are going to try and implement everything using 3.3V, and we will use 100 out of the 288 pins that the DDR4 DIMM connector provides. The complete bus should allow communication between the CPU/memory/UART cards.</p>

					<br>
					<h1>Power Supply</h1>
					<p>For powering the system, we are going to try and run everything on 3.3V DC. We also want our system to be wall powered such that the user can just plug the machine into a standard wall outlet and everything should just work. To accomplish this, we are going to use a wall adapter to take the wall power down to 5V. We will then use a buck converter 
					to bring the 5V DC down to 3.3V DC to power our cards, bus, and front panel. The buck converter will lie on a PCB with other discrete components in a basic circuit to maintain a constant voltage level of 3.3V.</p>

					<br><br>
					<h2>Operation</h2> 
					<p>Once everything is put together, users will use the front panel to write, run, and debug i8080 programs. Programs can be entered manually using switches, stored in memory, and executed via the CPU. Appropriate output can be displayed on some of the front panel LEDs, or can be sent over UART to another machine.</p>

					<h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to serve as the central processing and memory unit is demonstrated by the combined CPU and RAM card, which integrates the RP2350B microcontroller (with an external ABM8-272-T3 crystal oscillator and W25Q128JVS 128MB external flash) to emulate the Intel 8080 processor OR providing at least 4 KB of addressable memory for program execution (for example for use with 4K BASIC). The microcontroller’s PIO units are leveraged for precise bus control and timing, ensuring synchronization with external clock signals from the front panel. Designed to maintain signal integrity across 16 address lines and 8 data lines at 3.3V logic levels, this card also supports firmware updates (SWD or USB), debugging (SWD), and potential future expansions to extend system functionality (Optional population of 2 I2C-based MCP23017 I/O expanders).</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to offer an interactive user interface is realized in the Front Panel Card, which emulates the historic Altair 8800 front panel through an array of reverse mounted SMT LEDs (such as the KingBright AA3528SECKT), which diffuse through the fiberglass of the PCB, and tactile or slide switches (which are polled in a matrix to reduce I/O pin usage). This card not only provides status, address, and data indicators but also generates and manages multiple clock modes—including continuous 2 MHz operation, single-step, and off states—to ensure synchronized operation with the CPU and memory card. Additionally, it supports bidirectional communication with the CPU and other expansion cards via the backplane, allowing users to manually input and debug programs while maintaining ergonomic design and aesthetic fidelity to the original system. In order to assert address control, the front panel must begin a routine, where it asserts an interrupt, and drives the data lines to form a JMP instruction on-the-fly. This card is also implemented using the RP2350B, ABM8-272-T3, and W25Q128JVS, in an alterate (external) PCB layout.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to provide a regulated power supply is fulfilled by the backplane board, which includes a 5V to 3.3V step-down power supply using a reference buck converter design. This ensures stable voltage levels for all onboard components, preventing overvoltage damage while maintaining efficient power delivery to the CPU, memory, front panel, and any expansion cards. The backplane facilitates power delivery to the CPU and RAM cards via DDR4 DIMMs, and to the front panel via a series of FFC connectors. The board is laid out in such a way that there is even power/voltage distribution throughout the board.</li>
						<li><b>(Software)</b> An ability to emulate the Intel 8080 processor in software is achieved by the emulator software, written in Rust to decode and execute the full instruction set with accurate cycle timing and interrupt management. Unline many other emulators, which simulate instructions serially, this emulator is designed to emulate 8080 machine cycles, which respect concepts such as waiting for I/O operations. The system is called by, and makes calls to, various parallel bus PIO assembler routines.</li>
						<li><b>(Software)</b> An ability to manage parallel bus data exchange is provided by the communications software, which is implemented as a series of PIO assembler routines, to be assembled and processed by client software (such as the CPU, RAM, and front panel software). The PIO assembler is able to perform clock recovery off of the bus, provide calls to emulator code at the start of bus transactions, and allow for multi-device control of the same data lines on the bus.</li>
