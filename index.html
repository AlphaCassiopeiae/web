            <h2>Project Name: αCassiopeiae 8800</h2>
			
            <h2>Project Functional Description:</h2> We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. This device 
			in its minimally complete form will allow the user to:
			<ol>
				<li>Utilize the front panel to write, read, and execute Intel 8080 instructions in memory.</li>
				<li>Add expansion cards to allow the processor to read and write data over UART, to a disk, 
				etc.</li>
			</ol>
			<br/><br/>
			The front panel will contain 8 status lights to indicate the CPU’s operation, 16 address bit lights to indicate the address of the memory currently selected, 8 data bit lights to show the value at that point in memory, and 4 other CPU indicator lights. There are 16 switches for manipulating the data and address lines. These will be connected to I/O expanders that will interface directly with one of the GPIO pins on the CPU., There are 6 more switches for stopping/running the CPU, single stepping, examining a value in a memory address specified on the address line, depositing a data value at an address, resetting the CPU, and protecting memory regions. 
		<br/><br/>
			There will be at least 3 card slots using a DDR4 DIMM connector that users can slot expansion cards into.
			<br/><br/>
			Users can utilize the front panel to write i8080 programs for the computer but will typically use it to write a bootstrapper for an operating system the CPU can run. The lights can also be used as a debugging and step-through tool for programs.
			<br/><br/>
			Programs written or loaded will ulitize memory provided by a second base RP2350 card.
			<br/><br/>
			The CPU will be able to communicate with say a serial monitor over the UART card which will also be an RP2350 base card.
            
            <h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2></b>  
                <ol>
                    <li>PSDR #1: (Software) An ability to emulate the Intel 8080 processor as a device with internal states, and which is tied to the external clock/single-step on the 8080-bus.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #2: (Hardware) An ability to communicate between the various sub-components (cards, front panel) using an S-100-inspired 8080 bus protocol, implemented via RP2350 PIO.</li>
                    <li>PSDR #3: (Hardware) An ability to interface with the user via front panel display (red LEDs) and switches (slide switches and tactile buttons), allowing the user to control the clock/single-step and 8080 bus signals. </li>
                    <li>PSDR #4: (Hardware) An ability to supply 3.3/5V power from the backplane PCB to all the various components of the device using an integrated step-down power supply (buck conversion) from a reference design. </li>
                    <li>PSDR #5: (Hardware) An ability to interface all electronic and hardware components together in a hybrid enclosure design, where the front panel PCB, acts as a front panel for the enclosure, the backplane correctly interfaces with the tray slots in the enclosure, and all edge board and FFC connectors function correctly. </li>
					<li>PSDR Stretch: (Hardware) An ability to perform serial bi-directional communication via an additional UART card, allowing for the use of monitor programs such as Microsoft BASIC.</li>
