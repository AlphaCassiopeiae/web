					<h2>Project Name: Î±Cassiopeiae 8800</h2>
					<h2>Project Functional Description:</h2>
					<p>We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. The user interface for this device is a front panel with control switches and LEDs. This device in its complete form will provide the following functionality:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The front panel will provide the ability to write programs to run on the machine using the front panel. The front panel will provide switches and LEDs such that the user can interact with memory, this way users can read and write Intel 8080 instructions to/from memory to be executed by the CPU card.<\li>
						<li>The user should be able to add optional expansion cards to allow more advanced functionality, for example, communication over UART. These cards will be extremely similar to the CPU and memory cards, so they will simply plug into the backplane PCB using DDR4 DIMM connectors. 
							The user should be able to add/remove these optional cards to achieve the functionality they desire. For our project, we plan on providing a working UART card with custom firmware.</li>
						<li>Our machine will also be wall-powered, such that the user simply needs to plug it into a standard 120V wall outlet to power the machine. We plan to run all of our components on 3.3V, so we will need to implement some simple step-down voltage regulation to ensure the safety of our components. </li>
					</ol>
	
					<h2>Components</h2>
					<br>
					<h1>Front Panel</h1>
					<p>The front panel will make up the user interface of our design. It will use LEDs to display information to the user, and that will consist of 8 status lights, 16 address bit lights, and 8 data bit lights. 
					In terms of user control, the front panel will provide various slide switches for CPU control, memory examination, and reset functions. These will mostly be slide switches to mimic the original Altair, and these switches will connect directly to the CPU card, and the CPU card will communicate on the bus to write values to memory as needed.
					The clock generation will also be on the front panel, and will use switches/buttons to allow normal clock operation (2 MHz) and support single-step clock. </p>

					<br>
					<h1>Internal Cards</h1>
					<p>The enclosure houses a backplane PCB with 5 DDR4 DIMM connectors for functionality cards. These cards include CPU, memory, and UART cards, all based on the RP2350 microcontroller. All of these cards will have roughly the same layout, with the firmware/software driving the microcontrollers differentiating the functionality.
					These cards must be able to operate on the bus, which is heavily inspired by the original S100 bus used in the Altair. With the exception of the CPU and memory cards, the user should be able to add/remove the UART card if they want that functionality or not.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h1>Backplane PCB</h1>
					<p>The backplane PCB will be the motherboard for our system, and it will use 5 DDR4 DIMM connectors to connect to the CPU, memory, and UART cards. The traces connecting the DDR4 connectors will support our bus implementation, which will be driven by the microcontrollers on the CPU/memory/UART cards using the Programmable IO feature of the RP2350.
					The bus we're implementing is heavily inspired by the S100 bus used for the original Altair. The S100 bus used 100 pin connectors and some exotic voltage levels, including 8V, +/-16V, as well as +/-5V. We are going to try and implement everything using 3.3V, and we will use 100 out of the 288 pins that the DDR4 DIMM connector provides. The complete bus should allow communication between the CPU/memory/UART cards.</p>

					<br>
					<h1>Power Supply</h1>
					<p></p>

					<!-- probably redundant -->
					<h2>Operation</h2> 
					<p>Users will use the front panel to write, run, and debug i8080 programs. Programs can be entered manually using switches, stored in memory, and executed via the CPU.</p>
					
					<h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>(Software)</b> Rust-based Intel 8080 processor emulation tied to an external clock.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> S-100-inspired 8080 bus protocol via RP2350 PIO with DDR4 DIMM connector.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> Switch and LED matrix for the front panel interfacing with the CPU.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> 5V to 3.3V step-down power supply using a reference design.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> Serial communication via a UART card with custom firmware.</li>
