					<h2>Project Name: αCassiopeiae 8800</h2>
					<h2>Project Functional Description:</h2>
					<p>We plan to create a miniaturized version of the Altair 8800, one of the first personal microcomputers. Our system is implemented as 4 different PCBs, which are comprised of 3 unique PCB designs. </p>
					<ol>
						<li>The design is comprised of a Front Panel PCB, a backplane PCB, and a multi-function card PCB.</li>
						<li>A 44-pin bus interface provides 16-address lines, 8 data lines, and 20 bus control lines. The bus implementation is driven by the Programmable I/O (PIO) feature of Raspberry Pi microcontrollers, which allows for the configuration of state machines to allow for custom serial and parallel I/O.</li>
						<li>Delivery of bus signals and 3.3V power is facilitated by the backplane PCB. The backplane PCB connects to each card PCB via a DDR4 DIMM connector, and to the front panel PCB via a series of flat flex connectors.</li>
						<li>The user should be able to add optional expansion cards to allow more advanced functionality, for example, communication over UART. These additional cards interface with the same bus interface as the other cards do.	The user should be able to add/remove these optional cards to achieve the functionality they desire. For our project, as a stretch goal, we plan on providing a working UART card with custom firmware, using the same PCB design as our CPU and RAM cards.</li>
						<li>Our machine will be powered via a USB-C 5V/3A rated power supply. The USB-C connector connects to a receptacle on the backplane board, which regulates it down to the 3.3V level required for our system.</li>
						<li>All components are mounted on a two-piece alumiunum extruded enclosure, with the front panel mounted with machine screws on the front, the backplane riding on the mounting "ribs" within the alumiunum shell, each card mounted on the DIMM receptacles of the backplane, and two separate mechanical-only rear plates mounted with machine screws on the back of the device, separate as to allow for the two parts of the enclosure to slide apart even after assembly, with the removal to the top two front panel machine screws.</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Components</h2>
					<h1>Front Panel</h1>
					<p>The front panel will make up the user interface of our design. It will use an array of reverse mounted SMT LEDs (such as the KingBright AA3528SECKT) to display information to the user, of which consists of 16 address bit lights, 8 data bit lights, and up to 8 different status lights.<br>
					The front panel is implemented using an RP2350B, making use of an ABM8-272-T3 external crystal oscialltor, and W25Q128JVS 128MB external flash.<br>
					In terms of user control, the front panel will provide various slide switches for CPU control, memory examination, and reset functions. For the toggle dual-throw interface on the original Altair 8800, these will be implemented using slide switches. Whereas, the momentary dual-throw switches will be each implemented using two (2) tactile button switches.<br>
					The address and data LEDs can either be driven off of the bus directly, or via the microcontroller (to reflect the current state of each slide switch), which is chosen via a selection chip (based on the device's examine, single-step state).<br>
					The clock generation will also be on the front panel, and will use switches/buttons to allow normal clock operation (2 MHz) and support single-step clock (asserting the single-step signal in this mode). In order to assert address control, the front panel must begin a routine, where it asserts an interrupt, and drives the data lines to form a JMP instruction on-the-fly.<br>
					This board is intended to be mounted externally, meaning that the solder mask and silkscreen will be exposed at the front of the device. The front panel features a layout and silkscreen design that is reminiscent of the original Altair 8800's front panel to a reasonable level of aesthetic fidelity.<br>
					The board connects to the backplane via a series of flat flex connectors.</p>

					<br>
					<h1>Internal Cards</h1>
					<p>
						For this project, the PCB design for the CPU, RAM, and UART cards is identical, and the functionality is differentiated on the matter of the firmware loaded, the state of various jumpers on the PCB (to allow for the changing of I/O circuits), and the population of certain components (such as I/O expanders, UART connectors, etc.). Each board integrates the RP2350B microcontroller (with an external ABM8-272-T3 crystal oscillator and W25Q128JVS 128MB external flash). Each board features an internal USB-C connector, allowing for the board to be optionally self-powered during UF2 programming scenarios. Each board also features an SWD connector to allow for external programming. Bus and power signals are broken out into a DDR4 DIMM edge connector, which interfaces with the DDR4 DIMM receptacle on the backplane PCB. Based on the firmware implementation, the device can emulate either an the Intel 8080 processor OR providing at least 4 KB of addressable memory for program execution (for example for use with 4K BASIC) OR a UART device that responds to I/O bus operations, and tranceives them to an external UART port.
					</p>
					
					<h1>Backplane PCB</h1>
					<p>
						The backplane PCB is mounted internally to the enclosure, and features as least 3 DDR4 DIMM receptacles.<br>
						The PCB provides a regulated power supply, which includes a 5V to 3.3V step-down power supply using a reference buck converter design. 5V/3A power is provided externally via a USB-C connector mounted on the backplane board. This ensures stable voltage levels for all onboard components, preventing overvoltage damage while maintaining efficient power delivery to the CPU, memory, front panel, and any expansion cards. The backplane facilitates power delivery to the CPU and RAM cards via DDR4 DIMMs, and to the front panel via a series of FFC connectors. The board is laid out in such a way that there is even power/voltage distribution throughout the board.</p>

					<h2>Project Specific Design Requirements (PSDRs):</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to serve as the central processing and memory unit is demonstrated by the combined CPU and RAM card, which integrates the RP2350B microcontroller (with an external ABM8-272-T3 crystal oscillator and W25Q128JVS 128MB external flash) to emulate the Intel 8080 processor OR providing at least 4 KB of addressable memory for program execution (for example for use with 4K BASIC). The microcontroller’s PIO units are leveraged for precise bus control and timing, ensuring synchronization with external clock signals from the front panel. Designed to maintain signal integrity across 16 address lines and 8 data lines at 3.3V logic levels, this card also supports firmware updates (SWD or USB), debugging (SWD), and potential future expansions to extend system functionality (Optional population of 2 I2C-based MCP23017 I/O expanders).</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to offer an interactive user interface is realized in the Front Panel Card, which emulates the historic Altair 8800 front panel through an array of reverse mounted SMT LEDs (such as the KingBright AA3528SECKT), which diffuse through the fiberglass of the PCB, and tactile or slide switches (which are polled in a matrix to reduce I/O pin usage). This card not only provides status, address, and data indicators but also generates and manages multiple clock modes—including continuous 2 MHz operation, single-step, and off states—to ensure synchronized operation with the CPU and memory card. Additionally, it supports bidirectional communication with the CPU and other expansion cards via the backplane, allowing users to manually input and debug programs while maintaining ergonomic design and aesthetic fidelity to the original system. In order to assert address control, the front panel must begin a routine, where it asserts an interrupt, and drives the data lines to form a JMP instruction on-the-fly. This card is also implemented using the RP2350B, ABM8-272-T3, and W25Q128JVS, in an alterate (external) PCB layout.</li>
						<li><b>(Hardware)</b> An ability to provide a regulated power supply is fulfilled by the backplane board, which includes a 5V to 3.3V step-down power supply using a reference buck converter design. This ensures stable voltage levels for all onboard components, preventing overvoltage damage while maintaining efficient power delivery to the CPU, memory, front panel, and any expansion cards. The backplane facilitates power delivery to the CPU and RAM cards via DDR4 DIMMs, and to the front panel via a series of FFC connectors. The board is laid out in such a way that there is even power/voltage distribution throughout the board.</li>
						<li><b>(Software)</b> An ability to emulate the Intel 8080 processor in software is achieved by the emulator software, written in Rust to decode and execute the full instruction set with accurate cycle timing and interrupt management. Unline many other emulators, which simulate instructions serially, this emulator is designed to emulate 8080 machine cycles, which respect concepts such as waiting for I/O operations. The system is called by, and makes calls to, various parallel bus PIO assembler routines.</li>
						<li><b>(Software)</b> An ability to manage parallel bus data exchange is provided by the communications software, which is implemented as a series of PIO assembler routines, to be assembled and processed by client software (such as the CPU, RAM, and front panel software). The PIO assembler is able to perform clock recovery off of the bus, provide calls to emulator code at the start of bus transactions, and allow for multi-device control of the same data lines on the bus.</li>
