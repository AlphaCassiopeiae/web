<b>Date: January 30th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 5:30 pm</b><br>

<b>Content</b><br>
- <i>What did you work on?:</i>Front Panel PCB<br>
- <i>How did you work on it?:</i>Analysis of Front Panel PCB<br>
- <i>What was the result and what did you learn from it?:</i>Learned about the architecture of the front panel, figured out how the circuitry was laid out<br>
- <i>How did this contribute to the project progress?:</i>Had a general idea of the frame we are trying to miniaturize<br>
- <i>What are the next steps that must be taken?:</i>Need to finalize the front and back panel<br>
<br>
<b>Detail</b><br>
		I scanned through the documentation on the Altair to find the front plane found below.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\4.1.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		I figured out that multiplexing could be the most optimal way to achieve the layout we desired. After taking with Brian, I understood that he wanted to keep the 6 LEDs and 3 switches, but the rest of the design could be modulated.<br>
		I went through new documentation about similar projects that tried to achieve the same goal, specifically towards their PCBs
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\4.2.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		I am going to take most of these design considerations when making our final version and recording the electrical specifications.

<!-- Week 3, Entry 3 -->
<h4><b>Entry 3: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 29th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 8:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 4 hours</b><br><br>

<b>Content</b><br>
- <i>What did you work on?:</i>Regulator and Front Panel PCB<br>
- <i>How did you work on it?:</i>KiCad software in-lab and wiring tutorials<br>
- <i>What was the result and what did you learn from it?:</i>Started the schematic for the front panel, and layed out a better design for the prototype PCB<br>
- <i>How did this contribute to the project progress?:</i>Started both the front and back panel<br>
- <i>What are the next steps that must be taken?:</i>Need to analyze the electrical schematics further and see what routing needs to be done<br>
<br>
<b>Detail</b><br>
		I worked on a better design for the linear switching regulator, based on existing documentation I found only on the chip which I used in the intial design.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\3.1.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		This schematic has more detailed metrics on the performance. After which I did all the necessary calculations to build the new design, seen below<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\3.2.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		The new schematic had to be rerouted, which I completed. Afterwards, Professor Walter met with our team, where I completed the "Show me a thing", found below in the new 3-D Design<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\3.3.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		Professor Walter gave me some important insights on PCB design, especially towards working with the exist sketches and layouts in the datasheets. I will be sure to use this knowledge moving forward.<br>

<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 27th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 2.5 hours</b><br><br>

<b>Content</b><br>
- <i>What did you work on?:</i>Software Setup and SSH agent for project<br>
- <i>How did you work on it?:</i>Used eceprog computers and lab computer for setup<br>
- <i>What was the result and what did you learn from it?:</i>How to set up rustlings on personal computer and make ssh key<br>
- <i>How did this contribute to the project progress?:</i>Have a convenient environment to complete the rest of the project<br>
- <i>What are the next steps that must be taken?:</i>See if a docker container or something similar can be created to host the project<br>
<br>
<b>Detail</b><br>
		I wanted to set up a successful environment for the whole project, so I looked into setting up the SSH agent for ECEProg.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.1.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		After setting up the SSH key, I realized that the versions of software that the server was running could not support the versions of KiCad and Rust that we required.
		Afterwards, I switched to setup on my local machine, including the installation of rust and rustlings. It took a while and a lot of dependencies, but the installation was successful. 
		I also discovered that Visual Studio Build Tools was very much required.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.2.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		I made sure that the KiCad versions within the github were up to date such that I could work on them remotely anywhere, and tested that pushing and pulling to the EDA file was actually successful, which can be seen in the version history below<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.3.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		In the future, if more dependencies are needed, I will look into a dockerfile which will host a container

- <i>What did you work on?:</i> KiCad schematic for buck converter<br>
- <i>How did you work on it?:</i> Used KiCad schematic editor and layout editor<br>
- <i>What was the result and what did you learn from it?:</i>Functional buck step down converter, how to follow examples in datasheet<br>

<br>
<b>Detail</b><br>
	I started to relearn KiCad for the PCB design aspect of the class. I configured the following KiCad schematic file as seen below<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\1.1.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		Inside the buck converter file, I created the following schematic following the tutorial created by Phil's Lab<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\1.2.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		After spending some time rewatching the video, I layered out the PCB to avoid any interference loops and yield the best results in the PCB<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\1.3.png"></img>
		</div><br>
		Finally, after finicking with the layering and the layout of the page and PCB, the following 3-D view was accomplished<br>
		<div id="banner">

		I hope to bring this PCB prototype to manlab as an object to show to the TAs

- Worked on the power converter for the Altera PCB, incorporating Professor Walter's commentary.<br>
- Finished KiCad installation and decided not to use Altium for the board design.<br>
- Resulted in a preliminary sketch of the buck converter we plan to use.<br>
- This contributed to the project by providing us with a baseline PCB that we could visualize and start working on.<br>
- The next steps will be to use videos from [PhilsLab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab) and schematics found on the Altera website to generate the miniaturized version.<br><br>

<!-- Week 2, Entry 1 -->
<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 20th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on learning Rust and found documentation of an old project with a similar goal to ours.<br>
- Used Rustlings, an open-source GitHub repository with many tutorials for Rust, and read a 26-page documentation for the similar project.<br>
- The result was that we now have a framework to work off of and confirmed we will focus on Rust for our compiler.<br>
- This contributed to the project by providing us with metrics and past schematics for use.<br>
- The next steps include watching the project videos and seeing how the design can be updated.<br><br>
