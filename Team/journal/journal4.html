Today I worked on soldering the header pins onto the Raspberry Pi PICO 2 development board that we aquired for prototyping.  
<image of the PICO 2 board before soldering>

Since it has been a long time since I soldered through hole parts, I decided to find a soldering tutorial video to help remind me of the proper techniqies to follow.  I found this video on YouTube <insert link here> which shows how to solder header pins to a Raspberry Pi Zero dev board.  This video helped me remember how to tin the soldering iron, what solder iron temperature to use, and how long to hold the iron and solder to a pin to get a good solder joint.  It also showed that I should place the header pin assembly into the board then initially tack the header pin assembly in place at each end.  Then while applying pressure to the header assembly, I should reflow each tacked pin to ensure that the header assembly is fully seated and vertical.  Then the rest of the pins can be soldered one by one.  
<an image from the soldering video, perhaps from when the tack points are being reflowed>

I then grabbed two pin header assemblies from the cabinet in the lab and trimed them using diaganal cutters to the correct number of pins for the PICO 2 dev board (20 pins in each of the 2 rows).  
<image of the cut headers laying next to the PICO 2 board>

Next, I heated up my soldering iron (at our bench), tinned the tip, and then soldered the header pin assemblies to the PICO 2 dev board using the techniques from the video.  Here is an photo of the PICO 2 with the headers soldered.  
<image of the PICO 2 dev board with the headers>

Now our PICO 2 dev board is ready for prototyping and I have refreshed my soldering skills.-->

I need to finish up the PCB tonight, so my team will likely for a good portion of the night getting things done. I went looking for the AD2 as well as the cable, because they got misplaced on the table. I also realized it is much faster to leave everything within the Senior design lab in the future.<br>
I swapped all the silkscreen footprints on the board to be F.Fab prints, just so we wouldn't get confused in the future. The new board looks as such.<br>

</div><br>

I forgot to save my work editing the silkscreen, so a lot of my progress got wiped. I had to reset and update from PCB again, so I could trace again.<br>
I reconfigured the mappings for the PCB (again), because I realized my board was reversed and some of the RP2350 pins were not assigned correctly. Next, I will have to look at protection diodes and protection resistors for the entire board.
The Rat's nest was still looking hard to manage, so I have to reconfigure the mapping for the LEDs to make the routing simpler.<br>
I moved some of the components such that they were basically touching each other on the board, so that we could have traces with less length.<br>

I talked with Brian about changes to the KiCad files. He said that the library had been updated, and all the footprint models had been inserted. Now, I need to convert the front panel back into KiCad 8.0.0.<br>
I got a merge conflict when pulling from main, so I decided to use the modified files from main to do all the operations. The merge conflict can be seen in the photo below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week9\2.1.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Made a file called "KiCad Deprecation" which I will use to deprecate files from KiCad 9.0.0 to KiCad 8.0.0. I will basically copy paste structures into the google doc and export them back into new project files. I will do this for every component I need to.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week9\2.2.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I realized that copy and pasting in to KiCad would not be realistic, as when I copy pasted even a little bit of our existing schematic, the google doc shot up to 114 pages. I decided to just recreate the front board for our project, as I had already done it once.<br>
I recreated the Schematic in KiCad 8.0.0. I made sure to avoid all the pitfalls I made the first time, and removed the useless Nets, including VREG_AVDD and VREG_LX. I also created the new expansion connector, and made sure that between each 4 busses which actually had signals, I had a power and ground, and between the lines which did not have any usable signals, I had a power and ground between every 10 pins.<br>
I also recreated the I/O expanders and passed the electrical rules check like previously, such that we could get started on the layout. The whole (NEW) schematic can be seen below, as well as the passed ERC rules check.<br>
I had to find the severity rules in KiCad to determine which errors could be successfully ignored. I ignored three errors in the Electrical Rules Check, namely these three:<br>
- <i>Conflict Problems between Pins</i><br>
- <i>Library Symbol Editor</i><br>
- <i>More than one name given to bus or net</i><br>
I do not think these warnings will cause as issue, and we have records of them if they do. The exceptions can be found in the image below.<br>
<div id="banner">

After completing the entire schematic based on the one I already made, it looked as below:

</div><br>
I needed to complete the PCB board layout based on the schematic I created, so I opened the KiCad footprint library and manually assigned all of the footprints. There were 159 footprints missing, so I had to assign all of it.<br>
I set the following assignments for each of the parts that were missing:<br>
-
After this was complete, I went to the front panel PCB editor and started laying everything out.

During this team meeting, I needed to finalize the hardware prototypes and reconfigure the PCB for easier routing. I know that this week our PCB is due, but during mandatory lab we will probably just have a Soldering workshop, and since I am pretty well versed in soldering, I think that I should put most of the emphasis on the PCB.<br>
After I finish all of the PCB action items, then I can show my work to Professor Walter on Wednesday for him and the staff to verify this before printing, because our PCB printing is quit special.<br>
I began with trying to reroute the PCB, so it would be easier to trace. Obviously, I had to change some of the PIO mappings.<br>
I forgot to delete the second layer when I went to reroute the PCB, so I had to backtrack and get rid of it.<br>
By completing the route of the backside of the PCB first, I was able to drastically reduce the amount of traces needed. I originally thought to make my traces like the first PCB I did, but the routes would have been far too confusing.<br>
I made the mistake of forgetting to change the side of the board before routing, so I had to manually go through and fix all of that.<br>
Downloaded the QFN Footprint [1] for the MCP23017. This will make it easier to route, as well as the presence of less EMI. Link is provided in the references, but this is what it looks like. I plan to place this component at a 45 degree angle so the expansion covers more area per track width.<br>

I figured out that a global label would override a NET, so I decided to remove one of the nets on the I2C Lines. This was successful, and I continued making several routing into placement changes for the PCB

I took a look at my old ECE 20008 Buck Converter Lab, just so I knew what to reconfigure to get our desired output. I plan to make 3 prototypes: One using an LM1117, one using an LMC555 Timer, and one with our desired chip.<br>
I went to the ECE shop to see if they restocked on the MCP16331, or any switching regulator chips, but it did not look like it. I think I will have to put in an order for 1-3 of a chip or something similar.<br>

I attended one of the review sessions which was required for the Midterm design review.<br>
I asked the question of if the current team which was presenting (Team 2), was prepared for ESD protection for the user, just in the worst case that their input power or Buck Converter shorted.<br>
This review presentation session took place from 10:30  - 11:20, where I learned team 2's idea for translation glasses, which would have a PCB attached to the left of a pair of glasses.<br>
After this peer review, I attended another peer review session for team 18, Grid Wars, whose idea was to recreate grid wars with a microcontroller and RFID input devices.<br>
They decided to use a ESP32-PICO as well as a Raspberry Pi 4. One of the major questions I asked during the presentation, which response gave me some information to put in the survey, the distinction between the many grounds on the schematic.<br>
Another thing which I noticed was that they would be very financially or technologically constrained when making more cards for their game.

First, I needed to deprecated all our KiCad files from 9.0.0 back down to 8.0.0, following Dr. Walter's note which I saw below. I downloaded the older KiCad version of this site [1], and spent some time installing it.<br>
<ul>
	<li>
	This note came as a surprise to us, as we thought that KiCad 9.0.0 would be fine in order to continue our PCB assembly, but we were very mistake. We realized that we would have to deprecate all of our things manually, and recreate everything.<br>
	As such, I began to recreate the new schematic on a new ecad project within the directory, on top of the new files we had to make.	
	</li> 
	<li>
	I just saw this note 1 week into our PCB creation, so we lost a bunch of progress that could have been accumulated if we didn't make the switch to KiCad 9.0.0. However, I think that this will be helpful, as there will now be time to improve on the existing design and refine any inaccuracies that might have been there initially.<br>
	</li>
</ul>
The note which Dr. Walter left us can be seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week8\1.1.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I wanted to try a naive approach of just importing all the content into a text document and copy pasting that into KiCad. I first created a new google doc with my personal google drive account on the lab computer, and tried to import all of the KiCad 9.0.0 content onto that google doc. However, this did not work, as the KiCad 9.0.0 format was not backwards compatible with the KiCad 8.0.0 formatting.<br>
I also looked at the github branch history inside Github, as I thought that there would be a matching version which was not upgraded which I could work off of in order to restore my progress. The branch history which I was trying to compare to can be seen in the image below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week8\1.2.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I quickly realized that there was no good branch to siphon off of, as all of our changes were divergent and in separate KiCad Project directories, so there really was no synchronized version. However, at this time, the google doc finished uploading, and I was able to see all of the content of KiCad 9.0.0.<br>
I thought that there would be a way to deprecate the content of the KiCad 9.0.0, but after I saw that there were 114 pages of content and the file size was several MB, I decided to refrain from this choice and simply recreate the front panel and back plane schematics from their respective KiCad 9.0.0 files, just deprecated to KiCad 8.0.0. A photo of the very long google doc can be found here, and the file can be seen here [1].<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week8\1.3.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
After this, I admitted defeat and began to work on the conversion from KiCad 9.0.0 back down to KiCad 8.0.9. I first installed the KiCad 8.0.9 installer here [2], and realized that I could have both KiCad 9.0.0 and 8.0.9 on my system. This would allow me to switch between desktops and reference the existing design I had on KiCad 9.0.0 to insert it back into KiCad 8.0.9. The existing design which I had can be seen in the image below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week8\1.4.png" width = "25%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Afterwards, because I knew that the midterm design review presentation was next week, I decided to work on that and upload the new files to teams. KiCad was still installing in the background, because the installer is quite large.<br>
I create new files and made sure they were properly linked inside the teams, and go to work creating slides for the midterm design review based on the slides that were given to us within the assignment which was posted in Brightspace.

First, I needed to get working Hardware prototypes of the front and back panel, so we could put the issue to rest and consolidate the rest of our efforts on PCB design and manufacturing. I got these new(ish) Breadboards from the closest in the ECE 47700 Lab, and went to the ECE shop to get more components.<br>
The original breadboards looked like below, but I had to start over because our layout had changed.<br>

</div><br>
I went around the lab looking for wire kits and breadboard rubber boards, so I asked lab staff where I could find these materials.<br>
There were no rubber bumpers in the ECE 47700 Lab, and I got some male to male jumpers from the TA.<br>
I started wiring up the ground planes of the breadboard, which looked like below after they were finished.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.2.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I found two new breadboards in the storage drawers, and decided to use one breadboard for the new front panel and keep the existing front panel on the breadboard, just in case. I also decided to keep the spare just in case we needed it. A photo of all the breadboards can be seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">

</div><br>
I went to the ECE shop and got a variety of parts. The parts I obtained were needed for the front panel, which included: 3 DIP switches, 3 592TLC11IN Sink Drivers, 2 AD2 Breakouts, and 44 red LEDs, as well as 48 220 Ω and 470 Ω resistors. I put them all in a box, and will use the box for random part storage later on in the semester. The box can been seen below.<br>

</div><br>
I was actually lucky enough to find a MCP23017 I/O expander, the exact one we were using. I assume some other group was using it in their project. I looked up the datasheet here [1]. A photo can be seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.5.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I labeled all of the boards with white sharpie, so that we could distinguish the functionality of each of them. A photo is provided below. The labels I gave were: Front Panel (1), Front panel (2), Back Plane, and Spare.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.6.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I added the breakouts to each of the specific boards, and wired up the inputs to the AD2 breakout. Even if a short circuit occurs, this will not affect the AD2 breakout (I hope it does not occur). A photo is seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.7.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I needed the rubber bumpers to make sure the breadboard stayed in place, so I went to the TA to ask for some. He said that they did not have the rubber bumpers, so I went to the ECE shop and got 9 of them. A photo of the rubber bumpers I obtained is seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.8.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Afterwards, I applied all the rubber bumpers to the boards [2], and let them stay for a while, around 2 hours before they would set. A photo of a singular one is attached below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\5.9.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
The result was that the breadboards were set up with the necessary components, including DIP switches, TLC59211IN drivers, and AD2 breakouts, all properly wired. I was able to apply rubber bumpers to the boards to keep them stable, preparing everything for the next steps.<br>
This contributes to the project’s progress by finalizing the hardware prototypes, which will allow us to focus more on the PCB design and manufacturing.<br>
The next steps involve transitioning to the PCB design phase, ensuring the breadboard setup translates well into the final PCB layout. Additionally, I will keep monitoring the hardware prototypes for any issues that might arise and adjust the design as needed before manufacturing.<br>

I will spend most of this session ensuring that we had a working KiCad Library for all of our schematics.<br>
Based on my existing knowledge on KiCad libraries, I knew that each component needed a footprint and a 3D layout.<br>
I researched most of the components online, finding four of the necessary components for our library. The four I found are listed below, with their links as reference to their right.<br>
<ul>
	<li> ECAD for ABM8-272-T3 Model [1]</li>
	<li> ECAD for CONN SKT DIMM 288POS PCB [2]</li>
	<li> ECAD for FSM103A [3]</li>
	<li> ECAD for TLC59211IN [4]</li>
</ul>
I knew that I needed the electrical rules check to pass, so I needed to make efforts to ensure a PWR Flag was on every source of power where current was running through, just as Professor Walter had stated.<br>
I kept getting the "signal not connected error", so I had to manually attached power flags to each of these signals. This process was very tedious, and might have been unnecessary in the end. I will keep it in mind on a list of procedures to avoid. The cumulative power flag grid looks as such.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\4.1.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>

Then, I needed to polish up the library. I downloaded the proper ECAD off of the internet, off the sites I listed above, and then extracted them into the 3d_models folder that was inside our directory. After that, I added them to the specific project library we had. I had no major issues with this process.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\4.2.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I editted the names of these files before I updated the library, just to ensure we stayed organized. KiCad would normally download the file as the date, so the file name needed to be changed in order for the files to show as their prpoper component names.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\4.3.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Above, you can see that each of the component libraries has the proper name, which will be important in the future.<br>
The end result was a well-organized library with properly named and integrated components. I learned that while power flags are important, manually placing them was more work than needed, and I’ll look for ways to avoid that in the future.<br>
Next, I’ll continue refining the schematic design, ensuring all components are correctly linked. I'll also focus on streamlining the process and avoiding unnecessary steps, like the manual placement of power flags, as the library is now in good shape.<br>

<h4><b>Entry 3: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>

This evening, I needed to finish the PCB layout of all the cards on our PCB. This meant assigning and create footprints for all the boards on our KiCad Schematic, and making sure that the schematic passed the electrical rules check.<br>
First, I made sure that the PCB was up to date by pulling on Github desktop. KiCad 8.0 was still installed on my computer, and we migrated everything over to KiCad 9.0, so I uninstalled KiCad 8.0 from my computer.<br>
I realized that KiCad 8.0.0 would still have some remnants, as people online were complained about, so I looked into removing it completely from my system.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\3.1.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I was still unsure on how to create nets in KiCad, which would streamline the wiring process, so I watched a video on YouTube [1] showing me how to do so. After watching this video, I learned more about creating a net in KiCad.<br>
I was looking for a fast way to change reference numbers, because I know that we would have to be doing a lot of that for our very large PCB, so I asked ChatGPT how to change reference numbers quickly.<br>
I started changing all the reference designators for our project, which I knew would take a long time. We have over 100 resistors and 50 capacitors, as well as a bunch of switches, so changing all the numbers took very long.<br>
Next, I began to look into protection diodes to make sure our project would NEVER overcurrent or short circuit. I looked at the old Altair circuit diagrams [2] for inspiration.<br>
Additionally, I also had to find out how to find a certain net within a KiCad schematic, so I looked it up on Google and found this article [2]. 
It was presented to me that we would have to use matrices to register button presses, so I started looking back into the ECE 362 matrix scanner to see how we could implement it with the 24 switches.
<br>
I decided to annotate the existing power electronics that Brian conducted in order to make the schematic more organized before we go into Layout. To do this, I needed to make regions of each schematic which detailed exactly what was occuring, so the graders would have an easier time figuring out what was what. I made five regions in the front panel, all specified below by what their functionality is.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\3.2.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>

<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\3.3.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>

<b>Schematic area for scanning matrix (PDSR).</b><br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\3.5.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I quickly realized after I made the scanning matrix that we did not need it, as I2C communication would be enough to hit our PSDR. I knew that creating I2C communication may be a stretch, so I made sure to keep the schematic area outside the region of our paper, so it would not cause interference in the future.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\3.6.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
<b>Schematic area for microcontroller.</b><br>

I also wanted to learn how to make the components in the schematic equally spaced, so I looked up a tutorial on that. The tutorial can be found here [3]. This was very useful, as I could now align the components to a grid.<br>
In total, the keypad we will create will look something like below, with 4 rows and 6 columns for scanning, only using 10 of the 16 I/O pins on our expanders.<br>
I talked with Brian about the whole layout of our board, and he told me that he was still selecting parts for use in the DIM connectors and bus lanes. I think I will organize the footprint library and try to fix the ERC errors for now.<br>
After successfully fixing all of the ERC errors, I needed to fit the reverse mounted LED footprint such that it would fit on the back of our PCB.<br>
This footprint was found on the digikey website [4], and I downloaded the KiCad version.
<div id="banner">

</div><br>
This session demonstrated significant progress in finalizing the PCB layout, requiring both technical problem-solving and organizational refinement. Migrating from KiCad 8.0 to 9.0 was a necessary step to ensure compatibility and efficiency, and researching complete removal methods highlights attention to detail in preventing software conflicts.<br>
The effort to learn and implement nets in KiCad, as well as finding a quick way to change reference numbers, shows an emphasis on workflow optimization. Given the scale of the project—handling over 100 resistors and 50 capacitors—such efficiency improvements are crucial. The research into protection diodes and references to the old Altair circuit diagrams reinforce a strong design methodology, ensuring the project remains both functional and protected against potential faults.<br>

Today, I needed to update the team's website, because some of the changes I made yesterday did not stick. I first updated the documents page with A8, which Seth completed last night. I pulled this document from the teams and put it inside the Github repository.<br>
I replaced the existing A8 with the new one. I tried to get the front photo to work, but it was not functioning properly. I thought that the reason it failed last time was because the file was of the wrong format.<br>
I migrated over to working on the PCB design, and first needed to find a working model for the TLC59211IN sink driver to use in the KiCad schematics. I found this model online [1], which was an exact match for the one we needed.<br>
I put a photo of the existing Altair onto our schematic, just so we could always reference what the old one looked like. It looked as below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.1.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Afterwards, I tried to fix the footprint libraries, but because Brian had imported them and there was no real documentation within the KiCad, I could not make heads or tails of it. It just shows how important documentation is.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.2.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I wanted to use GitHub desktop to make it easier to push changes to the ECad files, so I went ahead and installed that and set the default repository to our repo. I thought that I would run into issues with the installation because I was using a lab computer, but there were no issues.<br>
The use of GitHub desktop [4] on the lab computer is seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.3.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I decided to add global labels to each of the signals in the schematic, based on the photo of the Altair, so I created and power flagged all 44 signals.<br>
Additionally, I added a new sheet to the schematic with references, such that we could stay organized. I started adding the datasheets to the components we knew we were going to use. I hope that the other members of my team follow suit.<br>
Afterwards, I saw that the MCP23017 I/O Expander, the expander that we are actually using, came, so I decided to take a break and solder all the pins to the MCP23017. I followed these instructions online [2], where I learned what the appropriate mounts for the solder are.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.4.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
The process to solder the pins was much smoother than the first time(s) I soldered, because I had more experience soldering and I was using a better soldering iron. I was able to get the pins soldered in about 30 minutes. I needed to solder a total of 16 pins, so I went one by one, following the process of heating the pad, applying the solder, and then quickly removing the pen. I did not run into any issues while doing this, and afterwards I went pin by pin and checked its appropriate connectivity to its pin across the board, as well as its non-existent connectivity to its neighbors. All the pins were soldered properly, and none of the pins were connected to their neighbors.<br>
I made the correct solder mounts and the final product looked as below, very similarly mimicing the picture above.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.5.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I realized that some of the pins on the Stamp XL board were connected together, causing a virtual short circuit whenever they were used. I needed to fix this, so I needed to go back and desolder/resolder the pins which needed it. I followed a very thorough process to do so, following advice I found online [3]. This tutorial taught me even more ways to desolder, and even gave me a streamlined process to follow.<br>
I went counterclockwise around the center pins, making sure each pin was not connected to its neighbors but making sure that it was indeed connected to the pins across the board from it. There were several pins that did not match this specifically, so I had to resolder them and then using the connectivity probes on the multimeter to ensure that they were working. After I did this for all of the pins, I moved to the edge pins. These edge pins were easier, and I followed the same procedure, and I was eventually able to verify that every pin was working.
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.6.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
However, while desoldering and resoldering 5 of the pins which were not functionally, I accidently bumped my pen into the male to the pin headers, which caused the plastic to melt. I removed the plastic via clamps, but I will have to resolder each of these pins again, a painful process I will likely do in the next entry. However, this was a meaningful learning experience, because I now know just how careful you have to be when soldering, and how you cannot make any mistakes.<br>
The removed pins, and the 16 pins I must resolder, are seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\2.7.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Finally, the board looked as above, and I learned some very meaningful lessons about desoldering, specifically. In the future, perhaps later this week, I will need to revisit these concepts in case we make mistakes during assembly.<br>
A significant challenge faced was troubleshooting the footprint libraries in KiCad due to a lack of prior documentation. This reinforces the importance of maintaining clear, well-organized records, as missing information can create roadblocks. In future work, a standardized method for documenting custom footprint imports should be considered to prevent similar issues.<br>
Moving forward, breaking down the remaining resoldering task into manageable steps could help mitigate the frustration of repeating the process. Additionally, testing pins incrementally rather than all at once might reduce the likelihood of needing to redo large sections of work.<br>
Additionally, another thing that I quickly saw and considered was the use of KiCad 9.0.0 to accelerate the development of our PCB layouts. I know that this version of the tool will be much better. I saw this information at this article [5], and seen below.<br>

This night, I needed to finish checking the stamp board which I had finished soldering the previous night. I realized that there was a connectivity issue between three of the stamps' pins.
I needed to fix this, so I went back and desoldered the pins, and resoldered them. I followed a very thorough process to do so, following advice I found online [1]. This tutorial taught me even more ways to desolder, using a conductive object to absorb the solder. However, the process would be quite risky.<br>
In the end, the new stamp looked as below, with all the incorrect pins, being the 10 pins at the bottom and three around the sides, removed.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\1.1.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Afterwards, because I knew I needed more practice, I went to get a prototype board which I knew had some mismatched pins, and desolder the board.<br>
I found one which the staff had given us, and I practice removing the pins, because the old pins had been placed the wrong way ahead. I knew that if we made a similar mistake, we would lose a lot of time, unless I learned to do this well.<br>
The old pins had been set to activate servo motors, but the entire breadboard did not work, so the idea was trashed. The board original looked as below, but with pins in the wrong direction to the ones visible.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\1.2.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I meticulously desoldered the pins, applying a lot of heat at the maximum temperature to remove them. I realized that if the solder was not applied at the correct temperature, there would be no chance to remove the pins. I read this article [1] about temperatures required to desolder pins in order to become more knowledgable about the ranges of soldering heat.<br>
Below is a picture of me going through the entire process, waiting a while for the heat to remelt the solder.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week7\1.3.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
This session was heavily focused on refining desoldering techniques and improving overall hardware troubleshooting skills. Identifying a connectivity issue on the stamp board and methodically fixing it demonstrated both patience and attention to detail. The decision to follow an online tutorial for alternative desoldering methods highlights a proactive approach to problem-solving.<br>
One key takeaway from this session was the risk involved in using a conductive object to absorb solder. While it provided an effective solution, it also introduced potential hazards that required careful handling. Successfully removing and resoldering the incorrect pins strengthened soldering proficiency, making future corrections more efficient.<br>
Practicing on a prototype board was a strategic move, allowing for hands-on experience in desoldering without risking critical project components. This foresight—anticipating potential mistakes and preparing for them in advance—is a valuable skill in hardware development. The research into appropriate desoldering temperatures further reinforced the importance of applying the correct heat range to avoid unnecessary damage.<br>

The third Raspbery Pi Stamp XL board came today, so I had to spent some time making sure it was operable because it looks like some of the pins were soldered already.<br>
I initially put the flexy pins in the breadboard as instructed from their website, but I realized that it would not match the configuration we were desiring, so I removed the flexy pins to put them in the right way. A photo of the initial incorrect configuration is seen below.<br>

</div><br>
I realized that I had to desolder the pins to ensure there would be no conflicts in the future, so I began learning how to do so. I first watched the following video below:<br>
Below is a photo of me following the procedure for desoldering with solder wick.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\4.2.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I was able to desolder some of the pins, but I realized halfway through that the pins were already electrically connected, so there was no point in soldering them. After which, I choose to resolder all of the pins in the proper mounting positions.<br>
I then put the flexy pins in the breadboard in the correct configuration, and I was able to get the RP to work with the breadboard. I will likely be using this configuration for the final prototype board.<br>
After which, I started to update the website with the appropriate schematics.<br>
I started finalizing the hardware prototype, using WaveForms and staticIO as my debugging tools of choice.<br>
I put in all the I2C lines and got everything working, through trial and error with testing each switch, sink driver line, and I/O expansion port.<br>
The final prototype looks as below.<br>
<div id="banner">

</div><br>
I got started on the KiCad schematic for the whole front panel, which I had to redo because my initial prototype was incorrect. However, I ran out of time as I had to leave for another meeting.<br>
With the Raspberry Pi Stamp XL properly configured and operational, the next step involved verifying its communication with peripheral components. The I2C bus was a primary focus, as its stability would determine the success of interfacing with the I/O expanders. Initial tests with the oscilloscope confirmed signal integrity, but occasional noise indicated a need for better grounding and shielding.<br>
With stable I2C communication achieved, the focus transitioned to integrating the front panel controls. LED behavior was tested under varying load conditions to validate brightness levels, and debouncing strategies for switches were evaluated. The design was also reviewed to ensure seamless integration into the final PCB layout.<br>
These advancements have moved the hardware prototype closer to finalization. The next steps will involve refining the software to implement more efficient polling mechanisms and exploring interrupt-based approaches for handling switch inputs. These optimizations will enhance the interface's responsiveness and overall performance<br>

During this session, I really needed to finish the hardware prototype, because as Professor Walter stated, we were very behind on prototyping and should have been creating PCBs at the given time.<br>
First, I needed to find the proper resistors to get the sink driver to work as intended. The old resistor values, the 150 Ω resistors, were not drawing nearly enough power to control the 592TLC11IN, so I needed to find a new value.<br>
I revisited the datasheet for the 592TLC11IN, and found that the maximum current draw was 200 mA, so I needed to find a resistor that would draw that much current or less. I found that an equation detailed in the datasheet [1] that would meet my exact specifications, so I needed to do the math to calculate the proper values.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\3.3.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I found that the resistor values I needed was closest to 220 or 330 Ω, Because they were the closest to my specifcations. I found this interesting graph on the datasheet [1] showcasing the performance of the sink driver with different resistor values.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\3.1.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I swapped out the final resistors, and the final decision was operable for the LEDs and switches.<br>
Next, I needed to make room for the I2C serial data and clock, so I connected wires to where these segments would go, in white.<br>
I knew that I had my LED segments done, but I still needed a I/O expander for the 16 switches on the front panel, as well as the 8 switches for bus operations.<br>
I went back to the ECE shop to look for spare I/O expanders and was able to find 3 spare ones.<br>
After the I/O expanders were installed, I decided to work with a smaller resistance value, the one given in the datasheets, there were some good resources showing me the switching characteristics of the sink driver, as seen below [1].<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\3.4.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
These values set a good benchmark for me, and I was able to implement the proper resistors and know the expected results of the sink driver. This will be very useful, as I am certain that proper resistance will play a key factor in our project, and slight differences might cause errors.<br>
Although I was fairly certain on my resistor values, I still needed to verify, so I decided to use the support website they had for engineering applications, found in the datasheet and seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\3.2.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I created a discussion post and installed all 24 220Ω resistors, so our board could progress.
With the LED driver circuit functioning as expected, the next challenge was ensuring that switch inputs could be properly registered. This required integrating the I/O expanders with the microcontroller and setting up communication over I2C. The initial wiring seemed correct, but testing revealed inconsistencies in signal transmission, suggesting that the I2C pull-up resistors might not be ideal.<br>
A logic analyzer helped visualize the data on the I2C lines, and an oscilloscope confirmed irregular voltage levels. Adjusting the pull-up resistors brought the signals within an acceptable range, allowing reliable communication between the expander and the Raspberry Pi Pico. A few test scripts verified that each switch press was correctly interpreted, though some inconsistencies pointed to the need for additional software adjustments.<br>
With inputs now properly received, the next steps involve refining the software to handle signal stability. Debouncing needs to be addressed, and an interrupt-driven approach would likely improve efficiency over continuous polling. Once these refinements are in place, attention can shift toward full integration of the panel’s functionality.<br>

During this mandatory lab section, I wanted to make sure everything we got from the staff was properly soldered. I also wanted to work (and almost complete) our hardware development board, such that I could show it to the 477 Staff during "Show me a thing".<br>
We got two Raspberry Pi stamp boards from the staff, but neither came with pins installed. I decided to install most of the connecters needed for the board to function properly.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\2.1.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>

The first connectors I needed to install were the male to female connectors [2], as seen below. I needed to use the wire crimpers to cut the connectors to the right length, or look for the proper size in the lab.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\2.2.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
There were also the two row variants of these connectors, which were exactly as they sound like, with two of the same rows. There were objects known as flexy pins, which were to connect the RP stamp board to the printed circuit board. I also noticed the presence of several external connectors, such as USB, LiPo, and UART. For now, we will have to put in wires for the LiPo interface.<br>
I connected the flexy pins based on the documentation that solder party had on their website [1], and I was able to get the RP stamp board to work with the breadboard. This taught me how the flexy pins normally work, and the mechanics behind them.<br>
After all of the flexy pins were installed, I made sure that the stamp was securely connected to the breadboard, and I was able to get the RP stamp board to work with the breadboard. To do this, I conducted a connectivity test with each of the 60 flexy pins.<br>
For the other Stamp board, Brian and Seth helped to assemble the boards, as well as the necessary components on board.
After which, I continued working on the hardware prototype of the breadboard. I still needed to crimp some of the resistors and LEDs, because I only wanted to make the breadboard once, through ample testing, and make sure I didn't have to reroute any of the wires on the breadboard.<br>
I installed the I/O expanders, and wired up the proper pins. After which, the hardware prototype looked as below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\2.3.jpg" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I showed my work to the 477 staff, and our team got some good feedback from Professor Walter on how our team should approach the following two weeks. Our PSDRs needed to be condensed, but still with an appropriate level of detail.<br>
After which, I updated our team website with the appropriate images and html formatting, as well as the documents and schematic downloads. In the following weeks, I will need to change my directive towards PCB design primarily.<br>
One of the challenges I addressed was the precise alignment of the flexy pins during soldering. Misalignment could prevent the RP stamp board from seating properly, leading to functional issues. To overcome this, I utilized alignment jigs to maintain accurate spacing and ensure the connectors fit as intended. This approach not only resolved the alignment issue but also reinforced the importance of precision in hardware assembly.<br>
These efforts directly contribute to the project's progress by establishing a solid foundation for the hardware setup. Reliable connections and proper alignment are critical for the overall functionality of the system, and addressing these aspects early helps prevent potential issues during later stages of development.<br>
Looking ahead, the next steps involve completing the final wiring for the I/O expanders and initiating preliminary testing of the GPIO functionality. This will include verifying voltage levels, assessing signal integrity, and identifying any potential sources of interference. Additionally, I plan to integrate a logic analyzer to monitor and validate data transmission between the RP stamp board and external peripherals, ensuring seamless communication and further advancing the project toward full functionality.<br>

First, I needed to fix a repository issue between the desktop computer I was working with in the senior design lab.<br>
The problem was that nothing was syncing correct, and I did not have access to the repository I was working within.<br>
I discovered that the lab computer was actually two separate accounts, the desktop and my huan1811 user account, so I needed to be very careful with the account I actually was using.<br>
I then needed to fix the repository, so I went to the github website and cloned the repository to the desktop, then made sure to save the repository to an individualized account which I would only touch.<br>
The issue found with the multiple accounts can be seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\1.1.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Next, I decided to do some research on how an I/O expander works. I knew that with 36 ports, we would eventually need at least one for our design.<br>
I decided to research the MCP23008 I/O expander [1], because it was a common I/O expander. Although we might not use it in the final design, it will be good to know.<br>
From the datasheet, I was able to figure out that the 8 ports on the chip were all bidirectional, so we could use the 8 ports as inputs to the RP2350.<br>
The datasheet can be seen below, with bidirectional ports.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\1.2.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I also found a video online [2], detailing how to use an I/O expander for an application where the GPIO pins outnumber the ports. I watched this video, and some important parts are below.<br>
After this, I was able to find another video on YouTube that was actually using a RP pico, so I able to gain incredible insight with that, which taught me that the GPIO expander was very usable with most microcontrollers.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\1.3.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I was scared because an older video [3] mentioned that GP7 could be write only, which would mess up our plans. When I started wiring, I made sure to wire right to left such that the rightmost switch was GP0 and the leftmost was GP15. I learned from the video the basic setup of the I/O expander.<br>
I also noticed during the video that a maximum of 8 I/O expanders could be used, so I made sure to keep that in mind. We probably won't hit that limit, but it is good to know.<br>
I will likely be EXACTLY mimicing the image seen below for the hardware prototype. After I am done with this, we will do all the software testing on this and there will not be a substantial need for another prototype board, for now.<br>
The image I will be mimicing is seen below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\1.4.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Also, for each of the 3 DP switch segments, I will need to create a level shifter for each of the segments. This will look like below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week6\1.5.png" width = "33%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
After creating this level shifter, I with need to make sure the DC buck converter is working properly, so I will need to create the schematic I found online [4] in the buck converter datasheet on the breadboard, making sure it actually regulates the output. From this datasheet, I was able to learn several approaches on how to create a working buck converter, as well as their efficieny levels.<br>

I needed to refresh my soldering skills, since I was rusty with soldering without the use of Flux, and the last time I had soldered without it was five months ago, during my Co-Op.<br>
I decided to watch this video, which showed me how to solder without flux, and how to properly tin the soldering iron. I also learned how to properly clean the soldering iron, which I had not done before.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\4.1.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Since I was still unsure of my abilities, I decided to take an old PCB and solder some header pins without flux to practice. I went to a solder station, heated up the iron, and got to work soldering.<br>
One of the things I figured out quite quickly was that although the iron was hot enough, I needed to let the solder sit for a very exactly amount of time, or it would either group up or not set.<br>
There was a method I began to employ, where I would heat the pad for exactly 2 seconds, put the solder and other things, and wait exactly 1 second, before removing the solder. This allowed me to consistently solder, with very little error.<br>
An image of me soldering is found below:<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\4.2.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Another thing I found quite quickly without flux was that the solder smoke would quickly rise. I needed to offset this by adding a fan pushing the smoke away from me at all times.<br>
After I employed both these tactics and protected myself thoroughly through eye and mask protection (from the smoke), I was able to solder 16 pins onto a practice PCB, successfully learning how to solder without flux.<br>
The prototype PCB I soldered is found below, with the 16 pins I soldered completely attached:<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\4.3.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Another thing which I had to do after the practice PCB was complete was check for connectivity. This would make sure all the solder points actually attached where they were supposed to.<br>
After testing all 16 points, they all beeped when I attached the multimeters' probes to them, so I knew that the soldering was successful.<br>
While soldering, I noticed that the heat distribution on the pad was inconsistent, leading to uneven solder joints. To fix this, I adjusted the tip angle of the soldering iron to ensure full contact with the pad before applying solder. This significantly improved joint consistency. <br>
Another challenge I faced was that some pins were not wicking solder properly. I realized this was due to oxidation on the header pins. To resolve this, I lightly sanded the pins with fine-grit sandpaper before soldering, which helped the solder flow better. <br>
To further refine my technique, I experimented with different solder wire thicknesses. I found that using a thinner 0.6mm solder wire gave me better control over the amount of solder applied, preventing excessive buildup on the pads. <br>

I began finishing the prototype for the front panel of the Altair. I had to make sure that the LEDs and switches were properly connected to the breadboard, and that the power was properly connected to the breadboard. <br>
I decided to switch from the PSU to the AD2 for digital testing, because the AD2 would stop any short circuits from interfering with my work. The PSU I used is show below, which was the one which might have malfunctioned my chips. <br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\3.1.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I had to fix the sink driver issue, so I tried to make it on one specific part of the breadboard to isolate it.<br>
The sink driver was acting up again, so I decided to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jXq5t6bl6MM) on how to properly wire up the sink driver, but when searching online, I could not find anything outside of a support document which was published.<br>
<br>
I found this old documenation of a similar issue being documentated, but it was not relevant to our situation.<br>
I talked to Niraj and he told me it was likely a breadboard issue, but we could also switch to the TLC59210IN, which would also drive the clk as well as the pins, so we will look into that.<br>
Afterwards, I wired the breadboard based on the schematic below, which I knew would work. However, when I went to try it, only one LED would light at a time, so I went back to the drawing board.<br>
When we actually go to create the board, I will be sure to install the TLC59210IN, because it is a better alternative to the TLC59211IN, which is known to have issues.<br>
This is the new chip I will install, seen below, rather than the TLC59211IN, which is known to have issues.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\3.2.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
For now, I need to isolate the issue with the sink driver. Because I thought that the breadboard was the issue, whether that be a stray wire or extra impedance interfering with the digital signals, I moved back to the original, smaller breadboard.<br>
Below are my attempts to isolate the issue with the sink driver, by testing one LED and a time and gradually adding more.
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\3.3.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I plan to make a concrete schematic of this circuit on post it to our Github schematic page later.
I noticed that even after switching to the smaller breadboard, the issue with the sink driver persisted. To rule out a potential power delivery issue, I measured the voltage at different points in the circuit. I found that the voltage drop across some connections was higher than expected, indicating poor contact in certain areas. <br>
To further isolate the problem, I used a logic analyzer to monitor the signals going into the TLC59211IN. The clock and data signals appeared clean, but the latch signal was occasionally unstable. This suggested that there could be noise interference or timing issues in the circuit. <br>
Before moving forward with the TLC59210IN, I plan to compare its timing requirements with the TLC59211IN to ensure that it will integrate smoothly into our circuit without requiring major redesigns. <br>

I began to work on the prototype for the Front panel with the sink drivers, LEDs, and the shift registers.<br>
Most importantly, I needed to find a way to test the sink drivers, because I was unsure if they were working properly. I found this portion on the datasheet, which was a useful reference and an example on how to wire up LEDS successfully.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\2.1.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I wired it up like in the example, and used the wire crimpers to get the optional length of resistors such that the components would fix exactly onto our board.<br>
Since we are going for a minimal design, I thought it would be best to start that practice, even with the breadboards.<br>
My work can be seen below:<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\2.2.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I knew that I needed to minimize the use of wiring, so I revisited some old ECE362 Labs in order to see how the circuit was wired optimally, because the circuit in ECE362 was quite large and a hassle to keep neat.<br>
I also needed to consider the pinout of the TLC59211IN, which I found that the voltage and ground pins were strangely connected, unlike most LED drivers. This can be seen below in the datasheet references.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\2.3.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I also watched this video on best wiring practices and layout practices for PCB design, because I knew I needed to improve my skills if we want to create something that small which still works.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\2.4.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I am likely going to return to the lab to test the sink drivers and recrimp the LEDs, because I am unsure if they are working properly.<br>
I ran into an issue where some LEDs were not lighting up as expected, despite being wired according to the datasheet. After debugging, I realized that some connections were not making proper contact with the breadboard. I used a multimeter to check continuity and identified a few loose crimps that needed to be redone. <br>
To further test the sink drivers, I used an oscilloscope to probe the output pins while toggling input signals. The voltage levels confirmed that the drivers were switching correctly, but I noticed a slight delay in response time. This could indicate a need for pull-down resistors to stabilize the inputs. <br>
I experimented with different resistor values to determine the optimal configuration for balancing brightness and current draw. A 1kΩ pull-down resistor seemed to provide a stable signal without excessive current consumption. <br>
Since PCB layout will be critical, I started drafting an initial schematic in KiCad to visualize how the components will be positioned and connected. This helped me identify potential routing challenges early on. <br>

<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>

<b>Duration: 2 hours</b><br><br>

Today, I began prototyping the new front panel for our Altair, which would incorporate both the power inputs and the LED and switch matrices. <br>
I had to get a bunch of components from the ECE shop in order to begin the prototyping build. I looked around the 477 Lab, but did not know where the parts I needed were, and there was no one in lab. So I went up to the ECE shop and got the parts I needed. <br>
I obtained around 30 red LEDs, 4 switch mounts for 8 switches each, and a bunch of wires for connecting the LEDs to the bound. My collection can be seen below. <br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\1.1.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I had to look up documentation on the [CTS 208-8 T208](https://www.ctscorp.com/Files/DataSheets/Switches/DIP-Switches/CTS-Switches-DIP-208-Series-Datasheet.pdf) 8 mount slide switches, because I was unsure how they worked with only 16 total pins. I found this part of the datasheet showing me how to connect the pins. <br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\1.2.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
This photo showed me how to adequately wire up the LEDs. I needed to make sure that each of the 4 8-pin SPST switches actually worked, so I needed a software to test them with, because our emulator was not 100% working yet. <br>
I decided to download Waveforms from this [link](https://cloud.digilent.com/myproducts/waveform?pc=1&tab=2), because we already had an AD2 and a breakout in house. I then tested each of the switches, following a procedure seen below.
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\1.3.jpg" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
As seen from the photo, I have to test each of the 32 LEDs.

Seth asked me to install the Rust toolchain, so I spent some time making sure the install was correct. I download a part of the Rust toolchain from this [website](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool), where I followed the install steps.<br>
I pushed my final changes to the github repository becase I had to leave for a meeting, but I let Seth finish the rest of the toolchain setup and documentation <br>
The tool chain I had to install is found below, which I had to install on my local machine. <br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week5\1.4.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
I encountered an issue while wiring the switches to the LEDs because the pinout on the CTS 208-8 T208 was slightly different from what I initially expected. I had to use a multimeter to confirm connectivity before proceeding. <br>
While testing the LEDs, I noticed that some of them had inconsistent brightness. After checking the resistances, I found that a few of the LEDs had higher forward voltages than expected, so I replaced them with spares. <br>
I also experimented with different resistor values to optimize brightness while maintaining power efficiency. A 150Ω resistor seemed to provide a good balance. <br>
During the Rust toolchain setup, I ran into a dependency issue where <code>cargo</code> failed to locate <code>rustc</code>. I fixed this by ensuring that my <code>PATH</code> variable included the correct installation directory. <br>
Before pushing to GitHub, I verified that my changes did not interfere with existing build scripts by running <code>cargo check</code>, ensuring the Rust environment was correctly set up. <br>

<h4><b>Entry 4: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: February 7th </b><br>
<b>Start Time: 7:00 pm</b><br>
<b>Duration: 2.5 hours</b><br><br>

<b>Content</b><br>
To refresh my knowledge of formal electrical specification documentation, I reviewed the IEEE guidelines, specifically their citation and documentation resource [insert link here]. This review helped me recall the proper formatting for references, system component descriptions, and technical content structure.  It reinforced the importance of clearly defining power budgets, signal interfaces, and electrical tolerances. <br>
I then revisited the existing Electrical Overview document, which details our project's hardware components, power requirements, and communication interfaces.  I revised the electrical implementation sections, ensuring accurate categorization of chips, sensors, and devices.  I also clarified the descriptions of data collection, software computations, and power distribution. <br>
<br>
Next, I detailed the power budget calculations, listing system voltages (e.g., 3.3V, 5V), the expected current draw for each component, and the resulting power consumption.  I also explicitly defined voltage and current tolerances for system safety. The table can be seen below. <br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week4\6.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>
Finally, I enhanced the interface considerations section with specifics on data rates and protocols, including UART, I2C, and USB, ensuring alignment with our system's communication requirements. <br>

Today I need to make the final edits to A5 so my team can all review it and revise it when we submit. <br>
But first, I need to make sure that files A1-A4 are update to date on the website. I realized the file links were NOT working, so I had to fix them manually. <br>
To fix this problem, I downloaded every Ax document into my local machine, then cut them all into the repository with windows explorer. <br>
I know that this is only a temporary fix, but my team needs to focus on the Documents. <br>
<br>
I also saved the templates to my local machine, and started working on the Component analysis. <br>
I began looking into three options to use for the step-down buck regulator:<br>
- [AP66200](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP66200.pdf)<br>
- [TPS732](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps732.pdf?ts=1738905137165)<br>
- [MCP16639](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/50002364A-766362.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOooVkFxeFBDgrx0sgl0E1YpkZdf0JIMJ615Z_p5xFBCXuGvBtz95)<br>
<br>
The website download links broke for a little, but they are back up now<br>
I wrote the specifications for our 3-4 parts, as well as descriptions of the power source<br>
Next, I looked at three options for the reverse mounted LEDs. I also watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkFOF71a2bk) to see how the mounting works<br>
- [XZMDKVG45WT-9](https://www.sunledusa.com/products/spec/XZMDKVG45WT-9.pdf)<br>

<br>
One thing which I incidentially discovered was that it may be a bad idea to use TFT mounted switches, as seen in the image below:<br>

Today, I tried to get software to successfully flash onto the Raspberry Pi pico. I followed the instructions found [here](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to install the raspberry pi pico extension in vs code. <br>
<br>
Then, I ran the example code after storing it in a proper directory. The software rebooted several times.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week4\3.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>

One thing we figured out with the dev board software was that every time we wanted to load something, we needed to disconnect and reconnect the device while holding the BOOTSEL button on the Pi.<br>
We also figured out to not overload the IDE with several 'run' requests, or the device would get overloaded and not work.<br>

I also realized I needed a JDK in order to successfully compile the code. Although the main.c was running without this, I figured it would be essential to have in the future. I downloaded the JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).<br>
I created an account an downloaded the JDK, and I proceeded to make a circuit to demonstrate that we have the ability to run any software we want.<br>

To test the circuit, I refreshed my knowledge of TFT tactile switches, by watching this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZXYRU9KPG8)<br>
I constructed a circuit to demonstrate that the pico could flash, and then showed my work to Professor Walter.<br>

Professor Walter said we needed additional description on the PSDRs, so I plan to fine tune and revise those tonight.<br>

Today, I began looking at running software through the rust emulator. I first looked at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwFWBP0IuRU) to obtain an ideal of how rust emulation would work on the pi.<br>
<div id="banner">

</div><br>

Seth began talking to me about the S100 bus, so I switched tasks to better understand the S100 bus on the original Altair. I went through the bus documentation on the datasheet, found in the image below.<br>
<div id="banner">
	<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week4\2.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
</div><br>

The most important parts of the S-100 (which has 100 signals), would likely be the address bits for reading and writing data.<br>
I took notes on what each of the ports and address bits take in through OneNote, and began thinking of the ways we would emulator the S100 bus, potential with a multiplexer to hit another PSDR.<br>
Afterwards, I opened the electrical specifications example and migrating our power consumptions to the electrical specifications.<br>

		After setting up the SSH key, I realized that the versions of software that the server was running could not support the versions of KiCad and Rust that we required.
		Afterwards, I switched to setup on my local machine, including the installation of rust and rustlings. It took a while and a lot of dependencies, but the installation was successful. 
		I also discovered that Visual Studio Build Tools was very much required.<br>

<!-- Week 2, Entry 1 -->
<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 20th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on learning Rust and found documentation of an old project with a similar goal to ours.<br>
- Used Rustlings, an open-source GitHub repository with many tutorials for Rust, and read a 26-page documentation for the similar project.<br>
- The result was that we now have a framework to work off of and confirmed we will focus on Rust for our compiler.<br>
- This contributed to the project by providing us with metrics and past schematics for use.<br>
- The next steps include watching the project videos and seeing how the design can be updated.<br><br>

<h4><b>Entry 3: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 17th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on the parts list for our project and documented A1 and the cost for each component.<br>
- Used several vendors (Digikey, Amazon, Kingbright) to look up and record price estimates.<br>
- Labeled and priced all the needed components for the preliminary PCB and converters.<br>
- Learned the process of purchasing parts.<br>
- Now we have an understanding of the total price for each of the components.<br>
- In the future, we need to refine our choices and make sure they fit the price range.<br><br>
