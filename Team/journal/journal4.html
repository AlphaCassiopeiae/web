Today I worked on soldering the header pins onto the Raspberry Pi PICO 2 development board that we aquired for prototyping.  
<image of the PICO 2 board before soldering>

Since it has been a long time since I soldered through hole parts, I decided to find a soldering tutorial video to help remind me of the proper techniqies to follow.  I found this video on YouTube <insert link here> which shows how to solder header pins to a Raspberry Pi Zero dev board.  This video helped me remember how to tin the soldering iron, what solder iron temperature to use, and how long to hold the iron and solder to a pin to get a good solder joint.  It also showed that I should place the header pin assembly into the board then initially tack the header pin assembly in place at each end.  Then while applying pressure to the header assembly, I should reflow each tacked pin to ensure that the header assembly is fully seated and vertical.  Then the rest of the pins can be soldered one by one.  
<an image from the soldering video, perhaps from when the tack points are being reflowed>

I then grabbed two pin header assemblies from the cabinet in the lab and trimed them using diaganal cutters to the correct number of pins for the PICO 2 dev board (20 pins in each of the 2 rows).  
<image of the cut headers laying next to the PICO 2 board>

Next, I heated up my soldering iron (at our bench), tinned the tip, and then soldered the header pin assemblies to the PICO 2 dev board using the techniques from the video.  Here is an photo of the PICO 2 with the headers soldered.  
<image of the PICO 2 dev board with the headers>

Now our PICO 2 dev board is ready for prototyping and I have refreshed my soldering skills.-->

Today, I tried to get software to successfully flash onto the Raspberry Pi pico. I followed the instructions found [here](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to install the raspberry pi pico extension in vs code. <br>

Then, I ran the example code after storing it in a proper directory. The software rebooted several times, as seen below.

One thing we figured out with the dev board software was that every time we wanted to load something, we needed to disconnect and reconnect the device while holding the BOOTSEL button on the Pi.
We also figured out to not overload the IDE with several 'run' requests, or the device would get overloaded and not work.

I also realized I needed a JDK in order to successfully compile the code. Although the main.c was running without this, I figured it would be essential to have in the future. I downloaded the JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).<br>
I created an account an downloaded the JDK, and I proceeded to make a circuit to demonstrate that we have the ability to run any software we want.

To test the circuit, I refreshed my knowledge of TFT tactile switches, by watching this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZXYRU9KPG8)
I constructed a circuit to demonstrate that the pico could flash, and then showed my work to Professor Walter.

Professor Walter said we needed additional description on the PSDRs, so I plan to fine tune and revise those tonight

Today, I began looking at running software through the rust emulator. I first looked at this video to obtain an ideal of how rust emulation would work on the pi.

		I figured out that multiplexing could be the most optimal way to achieve the layout we desired. After taking with Brian, I understood that he wanted to keep the 6 LEDs and 3 switches, but the rest of the design could be modulated.<br>
		I went through new documentation about similar projects that tried to achieve the same goal, specifically towards their PCBs

- <i>What are the next steps that must be taken?:</i>See if a docker container or something similar can be created to host the project<br>
<br>
<b>Detail</b><br>
		I wanted to set up a successful environment for the whole project, so I looked into setting up the SSH agent for ECEProg.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.1.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
		</div><br>
		After setting up the SSH key, I realized that the versions of software that the server was running could not support the versions of KiCad and Rust that we required.
		Afterwards, I switched to setup on my local machine, including the installation of rust and rustlings. It took a while and a lot of dependencies, but the installation was successful. 
		I also discovered that Visual Studio Build Tools was very much required.<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.2.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
		</div><br>
		I made sure that the KiCad versions within the github were up to date such that I could work on them remotely anywhere, and tested that pushing and pulling to the EDA file was actually successful, which can be seen in the version history below<br>
		<div id="banner">
			<img src="Team\journal\img - member4\week3\2.3.png" width = "40%" height = "auto"></img>
