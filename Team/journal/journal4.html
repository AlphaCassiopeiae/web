This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brightspace.  

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Project Journal for Nathan Huang</h2>
           
<!-- Week 3 -->
<h2>===============   Week 3: =================</h2>
<!-- Week 3, Entry 4 -->
<h4><b>Entry 4: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 24th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on the power converter for the Altera PCB, incorporating Professor Walter's commentary.<br>
- Finished KiCad installation and decided not to use Altium for the board design.<br>
- Resulted in a preliminary sketch of the buck converter we plan to use.<br>
- This contributed to the project by providing us with a baseline PCB that we could visualize and start working on.<br>
- The next steps will be to use videos from [PhilsLab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab) and schematics found on the Altera website to generate the miniaturized version.<br><br>

<!-- Week 3, Entry 2 -->
<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 21th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 2:00 pm</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Continued on learning Rust.<br>
- Finished several modules of the rustlings tutorial and found documentation of an old project.<br>
- Knowledgeable about concurrency and memory safety in Rust.<br>
- Now familiar with the code and can contribute meaningfully to Rust development.<br>
- Adapting the existing Rust compiler with our modified one to achieve a specified clock rate.<br><br>

<!-- Week 3, Entry 1 -->
<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 20th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on learning Rust and found documentation of an old project with a similar goal to ours.<br>
- Used Rustlings, an open-source GitHub repository with many tutorials for Rust, and read a 26-page documentation for the similar project.<br>
- The result was that we now have a framework to work off of and confirmed we will focus on Rust for our compiler.<br>
- This contributed to the project by providing us with metrics and past schematics for use.<br>
- The next steps include watching the project videos and seeing how the design can be updated.<br><br>

<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on the parts list for our project and documented A1 and the cost for each component.<br>
- Used several vendors (Digikey, Amazon, Kingbright) to look up and record price estimates.<br>
- Labeled and priced all the needed components for the preliminary PCB and converters.<br>
- Learned the process of purchasing parts.<br>
- Now we have an understanding of the total price for each of the components.<br>
- In the future, we need to refine our choices and make sure they fit the price range.<br><br>

<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 15th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 9:30 am</b><br>
<b>Duration: 3 hours</b><br><br>
- Familiarized myself with the Senior Design lab, presented project proposal to course staff, and filled out the course website.<br>
- Gave a 10-minute introduction to course staff about our project and some project specifications.<br>
- Learned how to map the network drive to edit the server directly, as well as how to navigate the lab.<br>
- Now we have a working network drive that will act as our server.<br>
- We have to plan our weekly meetings and get a timeframe for the project.<br><br>

<!-- Week 1, Entry 1 -->
<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
<b>Date: January 14th</b><br>
<b>Start Time: 2:00 pm</b><br>
<b>Duration: 2 hours</b><br><br>
- Worked on reading documentation for the Altera 8800, and seeing how everything worked.<br>
- Looked up footage of the Altera working, found several bits of documentation outlining the initial proposal and looked at some attempts to recreate the technology online.<br>
- Learned the basics of the Altera computer, as well as how it operates and is loaded.<br>
- Have a deeper understanding of the objective of our project, and can begin to assign roles.<br>
- The next steps that must be taken are the project specifications and related PSDRs.<br><br>
