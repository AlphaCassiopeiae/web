This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brightspace.  

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            During this hour I did some research about which programming language I should use for the emulator. I researched by reading other developers opinions about Rust, since I have never used it before. After debating between C, C++, and Rust, I decided on using Rust because Rust is fast like C, but it is memory-safe, which will be good for the amount of memory manipulation that emulating requires. Since some of my group already knows Rust, they may be able to help with the emulator if necessary. This contributes to group progress because I can now start writing the emulator for our CPU. The next obvious step is to learn Rust and research CPU emulation.

            We met as a team and formalized our various project milestones. We did this by listing desired functionality on the white board, then talking about what is necessary to acomplish the functionality. As a result, we were able to figure out more of what this project entails and assign team roles. This contributed to the team's progress by giving us a better idea of what exactly we need to do. Since I was assigned software lead, my next step is to look into writing an emulator for the Intel 8080 CPU, and to start writing it as soon as possible.

            This was our first lab meeting, so we spent half of the lab section learning about lab resources. The other half of the lab was discussing our project with the TAs and talking about project milestones within our group.
		We mostly just talked about rough milestone ideas without formalizing anything, but we got a rough idea of the various components of our project. This gave us a good foundation to do our own research and figure out exactly what all needed to be done.
		THe next step is to formalize our milestones and assign team roles, so we can start working on the various project components.
