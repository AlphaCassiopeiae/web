	<h4><b>Entry 4: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
          <b>Date: February 14th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->

		Spent this time researching the S100 bus a bit, and also looked into how programming on the original Altair 8800 works. I did this by reading some of the IEEE standard for the S100 bus and watching some YouTube videos in a playlist called “Altair 8800 Instructional Videos” about how to program on the Altair 8800, which our project is trying to mimic. I learned how the various switches on the front panel operate, including the examine switch for examining memory locations and the deposit switch for putting values in memory. I also read about the voltage levels on the original S100 bus, which were some pretty exotic levels including +/-16V, 8V, and +/-5V. The modifications we will make for our project include running everything on 3.3V and using DDR4 DIMM connectors in place of the original 100-pin connectors, although we will be not be using all 288 pins that the connectors provide (less than 100 probably for our desired functionality). I'll draw a rough sketch of the backplane PCB so it is clearer in my mind, seen below. Since we now have our RP2350 stamp boards, the next step is getting some Rust running on them so we can start emulating CPU/memory/UART for our functionality cards.

		Spent this time working on updating our website since our functional description was severely lacking in detail. To accomplish this, I just worked directly in our GitHub repository (specifically the index.html file) that is synced to our website (screenshot of some of the modifications I made below). I ended up finishing significantly more detailed functional descriptions of all of our major components, and I also revised our PSDRs to include more detail. This gave me, my teammates, and the instructors a better idea of what we are actually trying to accomplish with our project, which will help all of us in the long run. Since I don’t think any of us know specific details about the bus for our project, I plan on doing some research later today on how the S100 bus actually functions and how we need to modify it for our project.

		During this time I finished my portion of A5 and researched the S100 bus a bit more. I did so by writing in Word and reading the Wikipedia article about the S100 bus. It was hard to find some of the more technical details, but as a result I understand the bus we are trying to implement better. In terms of project progress, I feel ready to start prototyping with muliple RP2350s to try and get a crude bus prototype. Next week, we will begin actually prototyping and trying to get multiple components working together, such as CPU emulator and memory.

		We met in lab to work on A5 and starting to prototype on a breadboard. I spent most of my time writing for A5 on Word, and I talked with my teammates to figure out some details. I made good progress on A5, and I better understand why we chose the RP2350 over other STM or ESP micros. This contributes to project progress by fulfilling a required assignment and helping me understand what we are using each component for. The next step is to finish A5 and start working on prototyping/bus stuff next week.

		I spent a good amount of time reading and understanding the specs of the RP2350B microcontroller, which we will be using for our project. I did so by reading the datasheet online. As a result I have a better understanding of how our MCUs will interface with other components of our project, and I have a better idea of how to approach our S100-inspired bus. This contributes to our progress because we can now start working on the finer details of bus implementation. We should start prototypying once we get our MCUs and get working on our emulator next.

            We met in lab and finalized/formalized our PSDRs, and they now include more specific details about the emulator. The emulator should support all instructions for the 8080 CPU and listen to the clock from the front panel, rather than having its own clock. The other PSDR we changed was with regards to the bus and how it should work. I also spent a little more time on Rustlings, nearly completing the training so I can start working on the emulator next week. Next week I will start working on the emulator and figure out how to achieve the desired frequency. The RP2350 is clocked at 150 MHz, but the Altair 8800 had a 2 MHz clock, so I will need to write the emulator such that roughly 75 emulator instructions execute 1 8080 instruction.

            During lab section we met with the course staff to discuss project progress and review our PSDRs. After lab, I spent around 1.5 hours starting to learn Rust through Rustlings, an open source tool for learning Rust. As a result, we figured out what we needed to change on our PSDRs, and I also got more comfortable programming in Rust. We now know what exactly our project milestones are, and I am nearly comfortable enough with Rust to start working on our 8080 emulator.

            <b>Start Time: 3:30pm </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 1 hour </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
            During this hour I did some research about which programming language I should use for the emulator. I researched by reading other developers opinions about Rust, since I have never used it before. After debating between C, C++, and Rust, I decided on using Rust because Rust is fast like C, but it is memory-safe, which will be good for the amount of memory manipulation that emulating requires. Since some of my group already knows Rust, they may be able to help with the emulator if necessary. This contributes to group progress because I can now start writing the emulator for our CPU. The next obvious step is to learn Rust and research CPU emulation.

            <b>Duration: 1.5 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
            We met as a team and formalized our various project milestones. We did this by listing desired functionality on the white board, then talking about what is necessary to acomplish the functionality. As a result, we were able to figure out more of what this project entails and assign team roles. This contributed to the team's progress by giving us a better idea of what exactly we need to do. Since I was assigned software lead, my next step is to look into writing an emulator for the Intel 8080 CPU, and to start writing it as soon as possible.

            This was our first lab meeting, so we spent half of the lab section learning about lab resources. The other half of the lab was discussing our project with the TAs and talking about project milestones within our group.
		We mostly just talked about rough milestone ideas without formalizing anything, but we got a rough idea of the various components of our project. This gave us a good foundation to do our own research and figure out exactly what all needed to be done.
		THe next step is to formalize our milestones and assign team roles, so we can start working on the various project components.
