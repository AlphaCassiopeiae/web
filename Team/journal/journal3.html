			Had a brief team meeting this morning, found out that Seth did in fact get embassy-rp working again, and he was able to flash a blinky LED test case to the micro, and the code inside the main loop actually executed. Since I have a good idea of where our software stands after this week, I started working on the software section of the presentation for next week. I did realize that some of the documentation on our website could use some updates, so I started on that by implementing some of the feedback on A3 - Software Overview. As a result I feel somewhat prepared for the presentation next week, and I have a very good overview of our software that I can easily explain to my teammates when we all work on debugging later this semester.

			Started working on auditing the rp235x-hal code to support functionality of all 47 GPIO pins on the RP2350B QFN80 package. After reading through most of the repository and RP2350B datasheet (~1 hour), I saw a lot of changes that needed to be made to the UART, I2C, and GPIO sections of the code. Copying the existing framework, I added code to allow UART and I2C functionality to all GPIO pins, and I also enable the pins in GPIO/func.rs.
			<br>

			<br>
			Now that this is done, I can meet with the team tomorrow morning and try and use the updated rp235x-hal package. Hopefully we can get the code to flash to the micro and we can begin debugging our software. This week has felt like a lot of running into issues, but I think we are moving in the right direction. Worst case scenario, if Seth gets embassy-rp working again, we can always have this as a backup if embassy-rp runs into issues down the road (its RP2350 support is relatively new so I wouldn’t be surprised). Some of the changes to the rp235x-hal code I had to make can be seen below:

			Went into lab to try and flash the memory emulator package to one of the prototyping boards on our test harness with the new embassy-rp setup. I first had to move all of my code from eceprog to a WSL environment to use the USB connection for flashing. After realizing that WSL still couldn’t use the USB cable, I had to look into mounting the USB device to WSL. This required some PowerShell commands, but I was able to get the WSL environment to flash my code to the micro. 
			<br>
			<img src="Team/journal/img - member3/week7/W7J4.png" alt="website update" width="600"></img>
			<br>
			We did run into a pretty big issue, which was that the code would flash to the micro and everything looked good, except nothing in the main loop would actually execute. Although rp235x-hal didn’t support all the pins we needed, we were able to flash to the micros with it and the code in the main loop would execute. We decided that I am going to try and add functionality for all 47 GPIO pins in rp235x-hal, and Seth is going to try and fix whatever issues we have with embassy-rp. We now have 2 people working on debugging software issues and 2 people finishing up PCB layouts, so we should be able to fix these issues soon and start finalizing our CPU/memory emulators.

			As I suspected, there was a slight issue with the dependencies in Cargo.toml, but I was able to get it resolved by explicitly stating the version of ‘embassy-time-driver’ as 0.2.0. This did take some around 30 minutes to read through documentation specific to embassy-time, and about 20 minutes to resolve the issue in Cargo.toml. 
			<br>
			<a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-rp">embassy-rp repository</a>
			<br>
			 I was working on my computer at home, so I wasn’t able to try flashing to the microcontroller. I also had some issues with the code I had written in main.rs, so after reading more embassy documentation the code was able to build. If we just copy this setup to the other Rust packages we’re writing (CPU emulator, bus control), we should be able to get those flashed and tested in the next couple weeks, so we’re making progress towards software verification.

	<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: February 26th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 9:30am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 2 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
			During this lab section, we first met with the instructors, who told us that our new functional description was much better, but that our PSDRs could be a little bit more clear. I then spent around 30 minutes talking with the team and making the PSDRs on the team website more understandable. As a result, the website’s front page should be completely done and all details about our project should be very easy for anyone who reads it to understand.
			<br>
			<img src="Team/journal/img - member3/week7/W7J2.JPG" alt="website update" width="600"></img>
			<br>
			After that, we kept reading through the rp235x-hal repository, and recognized that some of the functionality only had support for the QFN60 package of the RP2350, and not the QFN80 package. For example, UART was only configured for GPIO pins 0-29, but pins 30-47 were not set up. Luckily, we found a replacement for this in the embassy-rp repository, which is another open-source HAL for the RP2350, and this one had support built-in for all pins on the QFN80 package. 
			<br>
			<a href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-rp">embassy-rp repository</a>
			<br>
			The setup process was almost exactly the same as for rp235x-hal, so I just needed to add embassy-rp stuff as dependencies in the Cargo.toml and cargo.config files. Integrating embassy-rp with the emulator was very similar to rp235x-hal, some code from main.rs can be seen below:
			<br>
			<img src="Team/journal/img - member3/week7/W7J1.JPG" alt="website update" width="600"></img>
			<br>
			After trying to build the code towards the end of lab section, I ran into a configuration error that can be seen below. Something was wrong with our dependencies (likely in Cargo.toml), so the project wouldn’t build or flash to the micro. I had to go to class so I couldn’t get this fixed in lab, but it should be an easy fix. In terms of project progress, this was a small step back, but we should be able to get this resolved and have support for the QFN80 package of our RP2350.

	<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: February 24th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 10:00am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 1.75 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
			Decided to start working on the microcontroller-specific programming for the memory emulator. I first had to spend about 45 minutes reading through the rp235x-hal repository to understand how to code with the macros and packages for the RP2350. The top-level README in the rp-hal repository was very helpful with getting it setup and providing examples for how to structure my code.
			<br>
			<a href="https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/tree/main/rp235x-hal">rp235x-hal repository</a>
			<br>
			Then, I had to modify the Cargo.toml and cargo.config files in the emulator’s directory so that the code would build. Took a bit to figure out, but I just had to add some stuff under [dependencies] in Cargo.toml to get the code to build. After integrating the rp235x_hal package with main.rs, I was able to get the code to build on my local machine. However, since I was on eceprog on my laptop (which didn’t support communication over the USB cable we’re using to flash), I was unable to get the emulator flashed to our prototyping board.
			<br>
			Doing this is a big step in our project since getting this set up allows us to start flashing code to the microcontrollers, meaning that using our test harness, we can start doing some basic tests with the CPU/memory emulators and the bus controller (called tram in our project), which are their own separate cargo workspaces meaning they can be flashed to different micros independently.

          <b>Date: February 21st </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->

			Started coding the emulator that will run on our memory card. Using Rust, I wrote some code to execute the read/write functions of memory. Using test functions, I am able to read and write to “addresses” in memory, which are really just indexes to a stack allocated array that holds bytes. The read() function takes a 16 bit address as an argument, and returns the byte located at that address (8 bits). The write() function takes an 8 bit value to write and a 16 bit address, and updates the array with the input byte at the index provided (no return value). Since the read and write functions work, the next step is to get the emulator to use bus signals to call read/write so it can actually function as memory for our system.  I didn’t quite get time to figure out what bus signals that the emulator needs to respond to, so I will need to look into the S100 bus a bit more deeply this weekend to figure out which signals need to be asserted by the CPU/memory emulators to handle reads/writes. I found a good resource that describes some of the signals needed for memory operations, I'll read it more thoroughly in the next couple days but a helpful excerpt can be seen below:
			<br>
			<img src="Team/journal/img - member3/week6/Week6J3.JPG" alt="mem flowchart" width="600"></img>
			<br>
 			I will need to figure out which IO pins we are putting MWrite, PWR, SMEMR, and PDBIN on and write my code accordingly. I will also be looking at the IEEE standard to guide my implementation, link below

			After realizing that we will need to emulate memory as well instead of using normal memory chips, I started thinking about how to emulate memory. The simplest approach seems to be using another RP2350B chip on a board exactly like the CPU card, but running a memory emulator instead. I read through the rs80 repository (linked in week 5 journal) some more, then made a basic flowchart for the memory emulator operation, seen below. The emulator will need to listen to the bus for read/write signals, then respond accordingly. Unlike the CPU emulator, the memory emulator will have its own clock so that it can constantly listen to bus signals.
			<br>
			<img src="Team/journal/img - member3/week6/Week5J2_memflow.JPG" alt="mem flowchart" width="600"></img>
			<br>
			We probably will be using a basic stack-allocated array to act as memory, but the emulator will need to respond to bus signals to control reads/writes. Keeping the emulator as simple as possible (basically just an array) will hopefully help us with easy debugging. Tomorrow I am going to start coding the emulator a bit, hopefully I can get basic read/write functionality done. Getting the memory emulator done would allow us to start using our test harness to figure out our bus implementation.

			During this lab section, we met with the instructors and figured out that our PSDRs were still not up to standard, and that we all have a slightly different idea of how our project is going to function. I spent a good amount of time talking with Seth about how we are going to handle software, and realized that we need an emulator for memory to run on a second card. I really didn’t get much work done during this time, but I feel like talking with the group changed the way I am going to approach the software implementation. Seth explained our test harness, which is two RP2350s hooked up to a breadboard, so we can run one with the CPU emulator and one with the memory emulator, so we can easily debug our emulators/bus. I’ll probably start thinking about the memory emulator implementation soon. The test harness we will be using to debug emulators/bus stuff can be seen below:

		Spent this time researching the S100 bus a bit, and also looked into how programming on the original Altair 8800 works. I did this by reading some of the IEEE standard for the S100 bus and watching some YouTube videos in a playlist called “Altair 8800 Instructional Videos” about how to program on the Altair 8800, which our project is trying to mimic.  I learned how the various switches on the front panel operate, including the examine switch for examining memory locations and the deposit switch for putting values in memory. I also read about the voltage levels on the original S100 bus, which were some pretty exotic levels including +/-16V, 8V, and +/-5V. The modifications we will make for our project include running everything on 3.3V and using DDR4 DIMM connectors in place of the original 100-pin connectors, although we will be not be using all 288 pins that the connectors provide (less than 100 probably for our desired functionality). I'll draw a rough sketch of the backplane PCB so it is clearer in my mind, seen below.

		 Since we now have our RP2350 stamp boards, the next step is getting some Rust running on them so we can start emulating CPU/memory/UART for our functionality cards.

		Spent this time working on updating our website since our functional description was severely lacking in detail. To accomplish this, I just worked directly in our GitHub repository (specifically the index.html file) that is synced to our website (screenshot of some of the modifications I made below). I ended up finishing significantly more detailed functional descriptions of all of our major components, and I also revised our PSDRs to include more detail. This gave me, my teammates, and the instructors a better idea of what we are actually trying to accomplish with our project, which will help all of us in the long run.

		During this lab section, we had our weekly meeting with the instructors, who gave us some good feedback on our functional description and PSDRs. In terms of actual work, I was mostly catching up with the team to see where everyone was at and figuring out how things were coming together. We are working on getting some Rust code flashed to the microcontroller as well as prototyping the front panel with LEDs and switches. I spent the rest of the time researching what dependencies and packages we need to use to get an emulator running on the RP2350 micros. After meeting with the team and instructors, we realized that our functional description on the website was severely lacking in detail, so I plan on setting some time aside later this week to overhaul it.

		Having learned Rust in the last few weeks, I spent more time reading through the rs80 repository that we are using as reference to better understand how to use Rust for CPU emulation. As a result I have a better understanding of the data types we will be using and how they will work together to emulate the Intel 8080 instruction set. I have an exam later this week so I’m not super focused on doing too much work for our project for the first half of this week, but I will be doing a lot more research later this week to figure out how we are going to emulate CPU, RAM, and UART as I’m sure they will be handled slightly differently.

		During this time I finished my portion of A5 and researched the S100 bus a bit more. I did so by writing in Word and reading the Wikipedia article about the S100 bus. It was hard to find some of the more technical details, but as a result I understand the bus we are trying to implement better. In terms of project progress, I feel ready to start prototyping with muliple RP2350s to try and get a crude bus prototype. Next week, we will begin actually prototyping and trying to get multiple components working together, such as CPU emulator and memory.

		We met in lab to work on A5 and starting to prototype on a breadboard. I spent most of my time writing for A5 on Word, and I talked with my teammates to figure out some details. I made good progress on A5, and I better understand why we chose the RP2350 over other STM or ESP micros. This contributes to project progress by fulfilling a required assignment and helping me understand what we are using each component for. The next step is to finish A5 and start working on prototyping/bus stuff next week.

		I spent a good amount of time reading and understanding the specs of the RP2350B microcontroller, which we will be using for our project. I did so by reading the datasheet online. As a result I have a better understanding of how our MCUs will interface with other components of our project, and I have a better idea of how to approach our S100-inspired bus. This contributes to our progress because we can now start working on the finer details of bus implementation. We should start prototypying once we get our MCUs and get working on our emulator next.

            We met in lab and finalized/formalized our PSDRs, and they now include more specific details about the emulator. The emulator should support all instructions for the 8080 CPU and listen to the clock from the front panel, rather than having its own clock. The other PSDR we changed was with regards to the bus and how it should work. I also spent a little more time on Rustlings, nearly completing the training so I can start working on the emulator next week. Next week I will start working on the emulator and figure out how to achieve the desired frequency. The RP2350 is clocked at 150 MHz, but the Altair 8800 had a 2 MHz clock, so I will need to write the emulator such that roughly 75 emulator instructions execute 1 8080 instruction.

            During lab section we met with the course staff to discuss project progress and review our PSDRs. After lab, I spent around 1.5 hours starting to learn Rust through Rustlings, an open source tool for learning Rust. As a result, we figured out what we needed to change on our PSDRs, and I also got more comfortable programming in Rust. We now know what exactly our project milestones are, and I am nearly comfortable enough with Rust to start working on our 8080 emulator.

           <b>Date: January 20th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 3:30pm </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->

            During this hour I did some research about which programming language I should use for the emulator. I researched by reading other developers opinions about Rust, since I have never used it before. After debating between C, C++, and Rust, I decided on using Rust because Rust is fast like C, but it is memory-safe, which will be good for the amount of memory manipulation that emulating requires. Since some of my group already knows Rust, they may be able to help with the emulator if necessary. This contributes to group progress because I can now start writing the emulator for our CPU. The next obvious step is to learn Rust and research CPU emulation.

            We met as a team and formalized our various project milestones. We did this by listing desired functionality on the white board, then talking about what is necessary to acomplish the functionality. As a result, we were able to figure out more of what this project entails and assign team roles. This contributed to the team's progress by giving us a better idea of what exactly we need to do. Since I was assigned software lead, my next step is to look into writing an emulator for the Intel 8080 CPU, and to start writing it as soon as possible.

            This was our first lab meeting, so we spent half of the lab section learning about lab resources. The other half of the lab was discussing our project with the TAs and talking about project milestones within our group.
		We mostly just talked about rough milestone ideas without formalizing anything, but we got a rough idea of the various components of our project. This gave us a good foundation to do our own research and figure out exactly what all needed to be done.
		THe next step is to formalize our milestones and assign team roles, so we can start working on the various project components.
