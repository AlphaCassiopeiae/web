                <p><strong>What did you work on?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Today, I brought my old ECE 362 breadboard in from my apartment, and will work on
                  transferring the setup currently on the other breadboard to the new one.
                </p>

                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <div class="image-section">
                      <img
                        src="Team/journal/img - member1/week6/phone11.png"

                        height="600"
                      />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Here's the state of my breadboard before I did any work on it. It still has my
                      ECE 362 lab work on it.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I removed all the components from this breadboard, organized the parts back into
                    my Mini Kit, and set up new jumpers between all the power rails.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then, at the top of the breadboard, I laid down foam tape and double-sided
                    scotch tape to act as a mounting surface for the carrier boards.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, I placed the carrier boards on the tape layers, and secured them with a
                    couple tacks of hot glue near the mounting holes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I then wired up the SWD setup that we had previously. I also included 2 slide
                    switches to be able to switch the <code>SWCLK</code> and
                    <code>SWDIO</code> signals between the two carrier boards, such that we can use
                    one Pico debug probe to debug both stamps.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="image-section">
                  <img
                    src="Team/journal/img - member1/week6/phone8.png"
                    alt="the newly assembled breadboard"
                    height="600"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Here's the newly assembled breadboard. I'm confident that the spring connectors in
                  my own breadboard are a lot more reliable, so this should be more usable for
                  prototyping and wiring all those signals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now that we have a reliable breadboard, I won't second guess whether a jumper
                  cable on the breadboard is actually making a good connection/circuit. With better
                  peace of mind during prototyping, the rest of prototyping should be faster.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I need to put together the ribbon cable wiring harness.</li>
                  <li>
                    I need to also remember to get the connector symbols and footprints (DDR4 DIMM,
                    JST, USB-C) we need to complete the card schematic and layout.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At the end of this session, I discovered that
                    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/rp2350-now-available-at-jlcpcb/"

                    that RP2350A/B would be available for consignment at JLCPCB! I need to figure
                    out how to consign these parts.

                  I decided to continue work on my own, and investigate the issue with the carrier
                  board with vertical pins.
                </p>

                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>

                      <img

                        height="600"
                      />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      First, I verified that I had the right carrier board (the one with the issue).
                      Yep, this is the one with the vertical-looking FlexyPins. Mounting stamps on
                      this is difficult, and some pins don't make proper contact.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    <p>
                      Here's what it looks like on the other carrier board, which I think is more
                      correct. I also took the opportunity to modify the stamp so that it had 2
                      header pins on it, such that I could use normal jumper wires, instead of
                      having to use the custom probing cables I made last time.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <div class="image-section">
                      <img

                    </div>
                    <p>
                      I went ahead and desoldered each FlexyPin individually, so here is the board
                      with all of the pins removed.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                      I tried to reinstall FlexyPins that did not have this issue, but the solder
                      from the previous job had filled the vias, and I couldn't effectively extract
                      the solder from the holes. Therefore, I decided to solder this stamp directly
                      to the carrier board using the castellated pad edges.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>

                <p>
                  I tested the newly amended carrier board, and it now works against the Serial Wire
                  Debug (SWD) setup. After some reworking of the other solder connections, I think
                  the board is ready to use. I learned about a lot of desoldering techniques, and
                  also other techniques to try to remove solder from vias, though the latter was
                  ultimately unsuccessful.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Now that the second carrier board is ready for action, we can now use both boards
                  for prototyping, which is important, since so much of our project hinges on the
                  communication between boards.

                  <li>
                    I still need to get my own breadboard to the lab, because I still think the
                    current breadboard we're trying to use isn't sufficiently reliable.

                  <li>
                    I need to set up the wiring harness between the boards, which I've decided will
                    be done with a ribbon cable, and Dupont connectors.

                  Seth asked me to come into lab today to help with an issue that he was having;
                  namely, he was trying to get Serial Wire Debug (SWD) working on the stamps, such
                  that each stamp could be programmed without needing to press the board's reset

                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
                <p>I did two main things:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Acting as a

                    debugging assistant for Seth.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Did some hardware work to build out Seth's testing setup onto a breadboard; into
                    something that could be further expanded into a larger prototype.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>More specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Seth explained that any Raspberry Pi Pico could be turned into an SWD debugging
                    probe, by loading the
                    <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe"
                      ><code>debugprobe</code> firmware</a
                    >
                    onto it. This Pico probe can then be wired into the target board's SWD port,
                    where it would supposedly "just work"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In particular, the instructions we were following were "Appendix A: Debugprobe"
                    of the
                    <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf"
                      >Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series</a
                    >
                    manual
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We tried to connect the bench oscilloscope to the <code>SWCLK</code> and
                    <code>SWDIO</code> lines on the board, but when attemping to communicate with
                    the board using both of the tools that we tried (the Raspberry Pi fork of
                    <code>openocd</code>, and <code>probe-rs</code>), the probe was unable to
                    communicate, and the oscilloscope signals remained steady.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I suspected that one potential issue with the setup was that the setup wasn't
                    stable enough for SWD (the current test setup were two boards on the table, with
                    two jumpers from the Pico jammed into the SWD holes on the carrier board. The
                    reason we did not use a connector is because the carrier board only exposes SWD
                    via a small JST connector, which we did not have on hand).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To try to rectify this, I tried to do two things:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <div class="image-section">
                          <img
                            src="Team/journal/img - member1/week6/phone10.png"
                            alt="two cables, which have clamping probes on one end, and male Dupont connectors on the other side"
                            height="600"

                        </div>
                        <p>
                          I dug through the spare table box to find a pair of Dupont cables, and a
                          pair of probes, which I then spliced together into a pair of single
                          cables. Instead of jamming the male Duponts directly into the header vias,
                          I instead used these new cables to to hook onto the FlexyPins, hopefully
                          providing a more secure connection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          I dug through the breadboard box, and found a breadboard, where I added
                          foam tape as a base layer, double sided table on top of that, and added
                          hot glue in small spots to attach each dev board into the breadboard, so
                          we can move every dev board together all as one. Then, I replicated the
                          debug circuit on this new setup.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      This new setup did not work either. We ran into the same no communication
                      errors, and the same flatline on the oscilloscope as we did earlier.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After some more time debugging, and reading the Getting Started manual, Seth
                    realized that we had been connecting the SWD of the Pico with the SWD of the
                    stamp, where in reality on a closer reading, we should be connecting
                    <code>GP2</code> and <code>GP3</code>. Upon some fiddling, the debugger started
                    to work, and we could flash programs via SWD.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  We got Serial Wire Debug (SWD) working by using a Raspberry Pi Pico as a debug
                  probe, and were able to program a Stamp XL using it. I learned about specifics of
                  SWD, debugging with a "Pico Probe", and to pay attention to the manual.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                  By getting SWD working, we can more quickly iterate on programs for the RP2350,
                  because we don't need to reach over and press the reset button to program each
                  Stamp. This also allows for us to program in automated testing suites.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I'd like to bring over my own breadboard from ECE 362 to replace this
                    breadboard, since the contacts appear to have been worn out (continuity did not
                    pass on certain lines on the breadboard, so we had to switch to different parts
                    of it)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I'd like to set up a wiring harness between the two breadboards, so that the two
                    Stamp XLs can directly communicate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I still need to investigate the issue with the vertical looking pins on one of
                    the stamp carriers. When testing som of its pins of continuity, they did not
                    pass. So, we could not use this carrier for SWD, and had to use the other one.

                    >respective carrier boards</a
                  >
                  arrived yesterday, but they're not assembled. The header pins, and mounting method
                  are not soldered on. I will be working on putting these boards together, since
                  they're crucial for communication bus prototyping.
                </p>

                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the stamps and their carrier boards, we also ordered two (2) bags
                  of one hundred (100)
                  <a href="https://www.solder.party/docs/flexypin/">FlexyPins</a>, which should
                  allow us to place or remove the stamps on the board. Seth was also in the lab that
                  day, so I worked with him to install the FlexyPins onto the board, which need to
                  be inserted one-by-one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I then went ahead and soldered down the FlexyPins for each carrier board. Then the
                  "Arduino Mega" style female pin headers, then the extra pin headers, then the DC
                  barrel plug. Nathan was also there, and he helped to solder the header pins on one
                  of the boards.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, I did a test fit of the Stamp XL boards on their carrier boards.</p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="image-section">
                  <img
                    src="Team/journal/img - member1/week6/phone1.png"
                    alt="two assembled stamp carrier boards with stamp XLs on them"
                    height="600"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>The two boards are fully assembled!</p>
                <p>
                  One of the stamp carriers had a greater angle to its FlexyPins, while the other's
                  FlexyPins appeared to stand straight up. For the one with the pins that appeared
                  to have an angle (about 45 degrees), the Stamp XL fit easily and snugly in the
                  carrier. It was more difficult to attach the Stamp XL to the other carrier board.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because the Stamp XLs are the only dev boards that expose all 48 GPIO pins on the
                  RP2350B, being able to use them is crucial if we want to be able to create a
                  prototype of our (fairly wide bus). Putting the dev boards (carrier boards)
                  together is another step towards that.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We need to put these boards together into a development setup, such that their
                    GPIO pins are connected together so they can communicate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I'd like to check up the carrier board that has the vertical-ish pins, to see if
                    there are any continuity issues.

                    after some discussion in ManLab, looks like we should get all of our PSDR ducks
                    in a row.

                  <li>
                    since i'm the one who is most familiar with our design requirements, i'll start
                    to work on iterating the different design requirements of our system
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    hopefully we can pluck out some descriptions to use as better and more complete

                  here's some of my notes about what i think is some functionality not currently
                  described in PSDRs we can use.

                    this computer is something that requires a lot of different boards to talk to
                    each other
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    we want design 3 boards: the front panel, the backplane, and the generic card
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the backplane is responsible for converting some unregulated voltage source into
                    3.3V power, which can then be distributed to the rest of the system
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    let's lock this in, let's take 5V 3A power from a USB-C port on the back of the
                    backplane board, which we then need to distribute throughout the backplane
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    remark: we may need multiple voltage regulator blocks throughout the backplane,
                    because of the distance that power and signals will need to traverse (we'd like
                    to step 5V to 3.3V as close to the module connector as possible, but this is
                    mutually exclusive from having multiple module connectors. the solution?
                    multiple voltage regulators across the backplane)

                  our bus is inspired by the Altair 8800's original 8080-based bus, but with some
                  changes for ease of implementation
                </p>
                <p>on the bus, we map:</p>

                    36 bus control signals BUS{00-25} (bus control signals {04-07, 20-23} are always
                    mapped to the same PIOs, the others can be swapped depending on the use case)

                  <li>
                    since we have so many UI elements (more than 20 switches and LEDs each), the
                    front panel should use expanders to address LEDs, and matrices to detect switch
                    presses.

                  <li>
                    the front panel must be able to throw the correct instruction onto the bus in
                    sequence to both jump and modify the 8080 CPU's program counter

                  <li>
                    the front panel must be able to perform both glitchless clock
                    activation/deactivation, and be able to assert signals for single-stepping mode.
                    the CPU and memory boards must be able to understand these signals
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    when the CPU talks to memory, the CPU must be able to understand memory ready,
                    I/O ready, and memory WAIT signals with memory strobes to allow for I/O
                    operations to complete

                  remark, i did mention to the course staff about possible supply issues with the
                  RP2350B chips. we may need to consider a backup plan
                </p>
                <p>
                  writing down here that setsuna did recommend possibly using multiple time steps of
                  some lines to assert bus control signals, essentially serializing the bus control,
                  something we can do with the RP2040's pin count.
                </p>
                <p>
                  if it comes to that, that's an avenue we can pursue, since ripping chips off of
                  evaluation boards in undesireable.

                  I ended up talking to Dr. Walter, and he made a very good point about the fact
                  that we are basically designing 3 different boards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  if we create detailed enough functional specifications for each board, then they
                  could all constitute a PSDR. I will work on this.

                <p><strong>What did you work on?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  I worked on coming up with ideas for our PSDRs, and also coming up with an initial
                  backup plan for if RP2350 supply doesn't work out.
                </p>

                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  I talked with course staff (primarily Setsuna, and Dr. Walter) about what changes
                  we should make to our PSDRs, and ideas of what to do if we only have RP2040s
                  available.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think we have a stronger plan of what to do for the PSDR changes, and a good
                  idea for our backup plan.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our PSDRs need to be revamped, since they're too simple right now. I've taken
                  charge of rewriting them, and this is a good brainstorming session towards that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I need to formalize our PSDRs and write detailed functional descriptions of each
                  of our cards that we can use as PSDRs.

                <p>things to review:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    check NCP1117 handling in the case where the 3V3 side isnt passive (situation
                    where USB is plugged in while entire device is under external [other] power
                    source..)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    check edge board substrate thickness, pitch, etc.... is it easy to route? can we
                    fit the jumper vias with the current pitch? swap from DDR4?
                  </li>
                  <li>find proper JST connector for GPIO pins 0-3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>remarks:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    check errata... do we need bias on GPIO40-GPIO47 due to weak/faulty internal
                    tri-state?
                  </li>
                  <li>reel supply of RP2350A/B not reliable, look for options</li>
                  <li>
                    4.7u guidance assumes pin 32 is far away from voltage regulation... check this
                    assertion later
                  </li>
                  <li>consider making the 12 latter jumpers have copper trace defaults</li>
                  <li>cutting/scoring as an exception may be less annoying than jumping always</li>

                    DIMMs have a weird outline (for insertion/rocking reasons, whatever), but will

                    only 77 are available? i guess some are doubled up

                    for the current connector choice

                <p>
                  The core of the schematic is done! I learned a lot about the specifics of
                  designing with the RP2350B, since I've only designed boards for the STM32F0 series
                  previously.

                <p>
                  <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a big step to getting the schematic completely finished! A good stepping
                  stone to that juicy PCB layout.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I need to recheck all the remarks I made, the voltage regulators handling if the
                  other side isn't passive, recheck edge board constraints, find proper connectors
                  (for UART), check the GPIO40-47 errata, check the chip supply, check the 4.7u
                  capacitor placement guidance, try making the solder jumpers have defaults. I also
                  need to add connectors to the schematic, and I may need to make a custom symbol
                  for our edge connector.

                <p>
                  I made a sketch to get a rough idea of what size and layout I want the card PCB
                  DIMM to have. I made some part selections for our schematic, based on the
                  RP2350B's reference hardware design. Additionally, I also made some design
                  decisions, such as including solder jumpers, and allowing for a second I/O
                  expander to be populated, to increase our I/O flexibility, and allow for the same
                  board design to be used for different purposes.
                </p>

                  I finalized some additional design decisions related to part selection and solder
                  jumpers, and learned about some specifics to hardware design with the RP2350B,
                  since I've only designed boards for the STM32F0 series previously.

                <p>
                  With this done, I pretty much have all the information I need to start laying out

                <p><strong>What did you work on?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  I finalized work on our initial pin mappings (what specific function we assign to
                  each of the RP2350's 48 GPIO pins).
                </p>
                <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  I cross-referenced against older notes I made, and continued to make use of the
                  8800's

                </p>
                <p>
                  All of our initial pin mappings are done, and now I have a clearer idea about
                  which processor status lines are critical for real time operation, and which
                  status lines are really only useful for the front panel.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Now that the pin mapping are done, I can go forward and set up the schematic for
                  the card, which is the hardware design that I'd like to start with. Making the
                  schematic for the card will also help with the schematics of the front panel
                  board, which also needs a RP2350B chip.

                  get our communication bus defined. This pin research helps finalize some of that.

                <p>
                  <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We need to finish up the initial bus pin mapping, such that we can get to the
                  schematic, and eventually PCB design.

                    Due to travel to IEEE ICSC 2025 starting on February 2nd to today at 10 PM, I
                    did not have time to work on the lab project, as I was preoccupied with the
                    conference

                    Setsuna recommended looking into tri-state buffers or GPIO expanders to offload
                    the functionality of certain pins
                  </li>
                  <li>Maybe can fulfill some 8212 logic? Or add back multimaster support</li>
                  <li>
                    GPIO expanders might be useful for less time critical signals... check those
                    (RESET?? certain S lines? P lines?)
                  </li>
                  <li>MCP23017/MCP23S17 for I2C line config?</li>
                  <li>I think most front panel signals have the fewest issues with this</li>
                  <li>Just need to make sure that those lines will not be used by e.g. memory</li>
                  <li>
                    Remark: Need to figure out the bus timing information + reset control timing
                    information (this will also be useful during A3, we need a state machine diagram
                    for different parts of the timing cycle [each different piece of software])
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Alternative, use the SPI flavor, and use two of these to free up address/data
                    lines
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Notably... 10 MHz 1-bit SPI cannot keep up with 2 MHz 16-bit parallel bus I
                    don't think... timing information investigation should help determine good fit

                    Notes for Wednesday: Figure out the last features to cut (protection lines?)
                    then set up notional 2350B package pin mappings (we want some sort of remaining
                    serial support + USB for programming... are we at a limit?)

                    Two options: Drop more lines, explore physical jumper setting of modes, or
                    delegate some derived signals to external circuitry

                    Random musing: WordStar I think has a version that ran on CP/M before getting

                  <li>
                    Might be worth seeing, if we ever get CP/M running, if WordStar would be

                  Big fan on how MITS defines 8 separate "Vectored Interrupt Control Lines" and then
                  proceeds to OR them all together into the 8080's one interrupt control pin
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remark: The real vectored interrupt priority was the DIP switches we put on the
                  peripherals along the way

                    the RP2350B has 48 GPIO pins available, with the current layout, we're using
                    37/48 GPIO pin allocations
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    have about 11 more signals to allocation (really iffy on whether we'll have
                    enough signals on the CPU card)
                  </li>
                  <li>most likely that we will not have mutli-master support, this is fine</li>
                  <li>NOTE, need an additional column of Intel 8212 I/O peripheral support pins</li>
                  <li>
                    i think the 8212 is mostly there to latch I/O signals (provided by from #D pins,
                    once) when starting I/O operations
