                I have some extra time to work on defining the software side of things. We need waveform descriptions of
                our bus transactions such that we understand the specific timings and arbitration required between the
                different cards.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>I realized that in order for the Front Panel to drive the data signals into order to deliver a JMP
                  instruction, there needs to be some arbitration line that ensures that the front panel has control of
                  the data bus.</li>
                <li><a
                    href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12194/how-did-the-altair-8800-front-panel-load-the-program-counter">For
                    reference</a>, the original Altair was able to circumvent this by routing the front panel signals
                  straight into the 8080 CPU, behind the input and output buffers.</li>
                <li>For this reason, I've decided to drop the SS (single-step) line, which I've realized won't be used
                  with our hardware, and created a new custom line called PANEL. I've updated our front page description
                  with this information.</li>
                <li>I'm doing a read-through of the Intel 8080 Datasheet to understand the timings of memory reads and
                  write, and thinking about how to try to adapt that to our bus sustem, which is slightly modified.</li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    I've found that the timing information is very similar, but I've found it useful to transpose the
                    8080 datasheet's information into signals that I could more easily understand in the data bus
                    perspective. I wrote up some wavedrom files with my understanding of the timing, and organized those
                    wavedroms as embedded within a draw.io document.

                Final PCB designs are due soon, so I'm coming into lab to finish up work on the schematic for the Card
                design. With the release of KiCad v9.0, we've upgraded the project to take advantage of embedded
                datasheet support, and are hoping some of the PCB routing improvements can help us.

                    I'm organizing and taking notes on the parts of the schematic that I have already. I'm using the
                    line tool to box in parts of the schematic that are logically separate, to make everything more
                    clear. Here I've boxed in each I/O expander into it's own organized unit.
                  </p>

                    Additionally, I'm also taking design notes (utilizing the <a
                      href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/hardware-design-with-rp2350.pdf">Hardware design
                      with RP2350 manual</a>) on the schematic for implementation details that we
                    shouldn't forget.

                      <p>
                        Because the card boards, in normal operation, are powered via the card edge connector, and not
                        via the USB bus, it's probably a good idea to have a reverse protection diode somewhere near the
                        USB VBUS regulation circuit. I've added a note to do further research into this later.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The L3 inductor in the 1.1V voltage regulator section of the schematic actually
                        must be polarized, and Raspberry Pi has worked with a manufacturer to create a custom inductor
                        to
                        account for sensitivities in the internal voltage regulator (This is the <a
                          href="https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/AbraconLlc-AOTA_B201610S3R3_101T/C42411119">AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T</a>).
                        KiCad does not currently seem to have a
                        default way to specify inductor polarization on their inductor symbol, so I will need to import
                        or
                        create a custom symbol for this in the future.

                    In order to better draw the dividing lines for the parts of the schematic that are directly linked
                    to the RP2350B symbol, I modified the symbol of the RP2350B (the veresion in the schematic, not the
                    library version) to spread out the pins (primarily the left side) to make it more evently spaced.

                    Seth mentioned the the debug experience he was having with embassy and probe-rs was spotty. I looked
                    into the issue and part of it was the issue mention in this <a
                      href="https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/issues/1736">Github Issue on Embassy</a> mentioning an
                    issue in probe-rs where it only resets one of the two CPU cores. For tracking, here's the <a
                      href="https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs/pull/1603">draft PR for probe-rs</a> looking to fix
                    this issue. Additionally, he noted that probe-rs doesn't pick up on certain debug behaviors of the
                    RP2350B.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of the reason we're using probe-rs is because we did not get OpenOCD to function with our build
                    environment. I noted that the Raspberry Pi work on OpenOCD had not been upstreamed yet, so the
                    stable versions of openOCD that we were testing against produced incorrect behavior against our
                    chips. I need to get a working version of OpenOCD based on the <code>sdk-2.0.0</code> branch of the
                    <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd">Raspberry Pi OpenOCD fork</a>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am working on building a version of the downstream OpenOCD version on Windows. OpenOCD has a <a
                    href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/blob/sdk-2.0.0/README.Windows"><code>README.Windows</code></a>
                  that mentions some tools that I can start with to try to perform the build. I've decided to go along
                  the <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2</a> route, so I'm installing MSYS2 on my computer. I also
                  followed the <a href="https://www.msys2.org/docs/terminals/">MSYS2 guide on adding the profiles to my
                    Windows Terminal</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  MSYS2 provides the <code>pacman</code> package manager, which I'm using to install build dependancies
                  onto the MSYS2
                  root. I'm referring to the <a
                    href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/building-openocd-windows.html">Espressif
                    documentation</a> on building OpenOCD for dependancies that I need,
                  which include <code>autoconf</code>, <code>automake</code>, <code>git</code>,
                  <code>make</code>,<code>mingw-w64-i686-gcc</code>,<code>mingw-w64-i686-toolchain</code>,<code>mingw-w64-i686-libtool</code>,<code>mingw-w64-i686-pkg-config</code>,
                  and<code>mingw-w64-cross-winpthreads-git</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I realized that the generated GNU Autotools <code>./configure</code> script was failing to find the
                  <code>mingw-w64-i686-gcc</code> target gcc, because I was running the UCRT64/MSYS2 shell, which loads
                  the wrong environment. Swithing to the MINGW32/MSYS2 shell, the proper alternative of gcc is detected
                  and used.

                  <p>I also added a MINGW32/MSYS2 profile to my Windows Terminal, by adding the following profile
                    listing to my configuration:</p>

                  <p>
                    For some reason, there's a build error trying to compile <code>src/flash/nor/rp2040.c</code>,
                    because it uses <code>uint</code> as a type, which isn't recognized. After running
                    <code>sed -i -e 's/uint /unsigned int /g' ./src/flash/nor/rp2040.c</code> on the repository to
                    replace the type usage, the project now builds correctly.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The build is working to build a version of OpenOCD that supports no interfaces. OpenOCD configures
                    build features via flags in the `./configure` script, which can be found when running `./configure
                    --help`. Because on the <a
                      href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf">Getting started with
                      Raspberry Pi Pico-series manual</a>, Raspberry Pi notes that RP chips can be debugged through a
                    generic CMSIS-DAP interface, I've opted to enable the <code>--enable-cmsis-dap</code> configure flag
                    and regenerate the Makefile.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>The configuration failed, because the inclusion of CMSIS-DAP support requires the
                  <code>hidapi</code> library.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Looking through the MSYS2 package listing, I found a good candidate: <a
                    href="https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-hidapi"><code>mingw-w64-hidapi</code></a>. I then
                  ran
                  <code>pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-hidapi</code> to install the MINGW32 version of the package.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The configure script now passes, but running the Makefile fails, because sometime later, some parts
                  of the CMSIS-DAP implementation try to reference <code>libusb-1.0.h</code>, which I have not provided.
                  I will need to provide the libusb 1.0 DLLs and header files somehow
                </li>

                  Unfortunately, while the MSYS2 base package for libusb exists (<a
                    href="https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-libusb"><code>mingw-w64-libusb</code></a>), there's
                  no MINGW32 version of the package available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I've also tried to include the library in the same way that the previous Espressif guide did, but for
                  some reason the configure script does not pick up libusb, and it still does not build.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I've decided to package a MINGW32/MSYS2 package myself. I took a look at the existing <a
                    href="https://packages.msys2.org/packages/mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb">MINGW64 package for libusb</a>.
                  Basically, it provides the following files:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/bin/libusb-1.0.dll</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/include/libusb-1.0/libusb.h</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/lib/libusb-1.0.a</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/lib/libusb-1.0.dll.a</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/lib/pkgconfig/libusb-1.0.pc</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw64/share/licenses/libusb/COPYING</code></li>
                  </ul>
                  Taking reference of this structure, I created a new archive based on the <a
                    href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/tag/v1.0.27">MINGw32 build of libusb 1.0.27</a>,
                  moving the files into an archive to fill out these files:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>/mingw32/bin/libusb-1.0.dll</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw32/include/libusb-1.0/libusb.h</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw32/lib/libusb-1.0.a</code></li>
                    <li><code>/mingw32/lib/libusb-1.0.dll.a</code></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    I then copied over the pkgconfig configuration from the MINGW64 package, and modified to reference
                    MINGW32 paths, and placed it in <code>/mingw32/lib/pkgconfig/libusb-1.0.pc</code>. I also copied
                    over
                    the <code>COPYING</code> file as-is.
                  </p>

                    OpenOCD now properly builds with CMSIS-DAP support and the new RP2350B support. I've shared the
                    binary (which requires you to bundle the hidapi and libusb DLL files), and it works on his computer.
                    We have a more battle-tested debug tool that also has written support by Raspberry Pi.

                    Nathan noted that instead of having all our schematics and PCBs in one KiCad Project, per submission
                    guidelines, we needed to split each board out into a separate project. We decided that it would be
                    best to have a single KiCad .lib file that all the projects could reference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I thought this would be a good time to part out some of the core connector choices we needed, so I
                    found the following parts to add to the library:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a
                        href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/amphenol-cs-fci/10145226-0241N13LF/10233356">10145226-0241N13LF</a>
                      as a DDR4 DIMM slot, which I chose over <a
                        href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/2308107-9/6596874">2308107-9</a>
                      because of footprint availability, and <a
                        href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/amphenol-cs-fci/10145891-0320J13LF/10233357">10145891-0320J13LF</a>
                      because the latter is a very hard to solder SMD part with 288 contacts.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/2171750001/13913745">2171750001</a> as
                      our USB-C connector, because it's very popular, and I'm not expecting too many issues from it,
                      since it's a Molex part.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, I've decided to use the same schematic symbol for DDR4 DIMM connections between the
                    edge card and the slot, but we lack a footprint in the edge card case. I found an <a
                      href="https://github.com/DiodeRed/kicad-footprint-ddr4-dimm/blob/master/DIMM-DDR4.kicad_mod">edge
                      card footprint</a> online that I'm importing to use with the slot symbol.
                  </p>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    I also took the liberty of selecting the slide switches and buttons we will use:

                  <ul>
                    <li><a

                      as a slide switch because of its fairly hefty casing that extends through hole into the PCB, which
                      makes be believe that it will be less likely to rip off of a PCB.</li>
                    <li><a

                      as a tactile momentary switch, as it allows the attachment of caps onto the stem, allowing for
                      aesthetic customization.</li>
                  </ul>

              At my apartment, I found a reel of Raspberry Pi Picos that still had two spare boards on them. Seth is
              using the spare UART port on our current debug probe in order to receive debug messages, but it's
              inconvients to have only one probe to do this while having to test two devices (the stamps). I'm going
              to assemble and install an additional probe, such that we no longer need to fo the SWD wire switching,
              and can debug and receive messages from both stamps simultaneously.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    I picked out a Pico board from the strip of the reel that I brought to lab.
                  <div class="image-section">

                  </div>
                  I'm going to add header pins to this Pico such that I can be installed onto a breadboard.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    I mounted the Pico with header pins onto a breadboard to provide alignment for soldering.
                  <div class="image-section">

                  <p>
                    I tacked the 4 corners of the board with 4 connections each to make sure sthat the header pins were
                    attached mechanically secure to the pico. I could now remove the Pico from the board, and complete
                    the job on the helping hands.
                  <div class="image-section">

                  <p>
                    I mounted the Pico onto the helping hands, and finished soldering on the header pin rows to finish
                    the electrical connection.
                  <div class="image-section">

                <li>
                  <p>
                    I then removed the Pico from the helping hands and flipped it over to add the SWD header. I tacked
                    solder onto the two ends of the header row to support it, and then finished the last pin.

                  <p>
                    Now it's time to wire the new Pico into the breadboard. The SWD signals on the bottom end of the
                    breadboard will remain connected to the lower debug probe. I've disconnected the top SWD signals.
                    These signals will be connected to the new Pico.
                  <div class="image-section">

                    I've gone and removed the slide switches we used to switch the target board for the single debug
                    probe, and directly connected the lower SWD signals to the lower debug probe.
                  <div class="image-section">

                  <p>
                    I then connected the upper <code>>SWCLK</code> to the new Pico's GPIO 2, and the upper
                    <code>SWDIO</code> to the new Pico's GPIO 3, as specified in Appendix A of the <a

                  <p>
                    I've now connected the gound and 3.3V out signals to the power columns on the breadboard, according
                    to
                    the <a

                </li>
              </ul>

              This should make deubgging smoother, since now we can connect both probes to a development computer, and
              program/test both stamps at the same time without needing to toggle switches back and forth.

                I'm working on completing and verifying all of the cable harnesses (ribbon cables) that we need for
                communication between two boards. Currently, a pair of cables is complete, each of which has 24
                conductors. These represent the 16 address lines, plus the 8 data lines of the bus. Today, I'll try to
                verify that the circuit for these two 24 conductor cables in good, and also work on the 20 conductor

                  directly on each Stamp XL. This tests that the connection between the GPIO pins that I'm interested in
                  (<code>GPIO24</code> thhrough <code>GPIO47</code>), is good.
                  <ul>
                    <li>To figure out which pins to test, I used the <a
                        href="https://www.solder.party/docs/rp2xxx-stamp-related/rp2350-stamp-xl/downloads/">Stamp XL's
                        leaflet diagram</a>, and probed GPIOs 24-47.</li>
                    <li>Pins 24-29, which are on the bottom on the leaflet diagram, pass continuity</li>
                    <li>Pin 30 does not pass continuity. Pins 31-39 pass continuity. These pins are on the right side of
                      the leaflet diagram.</li>
                    <li>Pins 40-47, which are on the top on the leaflet diagram, pass continuity</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>I will need to investigate which part is causing the connection between the Pin 30s to misbehave.
                    This connection fault could be in the FlexyPin, the header pins, the crimp in the ribbon cable, the
                    cable itself, or the breadboard. I'll eliminate these potential faults one-by-one.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I've eliminated the possibility of it being a FlexyPin issue by probing between the carrier
                      board and the Stamp XL</li>
                    <li>I've eliminated the possibility of it being a header pin issue by probing between the Stamp XL,
                      and a jumper cable connected to the suspected header pin</li>
                    <li>I've eliminated the possibility of it being a breadboard issue by moving the connections to a
                      different part of the breadboard, and reprobing the entire bevy of pins.</li>

                      <p>I've found that the continuity issue is a fault with a cable. In particular the cable harness
                        used on the left stamp carrier board. This was found by placing a spring probe on the breadboard
                        side of the ribbon cable, and probing Pin 30 of the Stamp XL on the other side. While the right
                        setup passes the continuity test, the left setup does not.</p>

                  <p>In assembling so many Dupont crimp connectors, I've learned some techniques to make the process
                    smoother. Rounding out the cable hold using the round hole grippers at the end of this stripper
                    makes the insertion of the crimp connector into its housing a lot easier.</p>

                I'm hunkering down and working on crimping and wiring in the prototype wiring
                harnesses. These are required so that we can get on with testing the bus signal

                Additionally, on a meta note, I've reformatted my journal such that the entries

                easier to make journal entires. Hopefully this process is smoother from here on
                out.

                  In the lab, there's this reel of ribbon cable that I plan to use. It's got the

                  In particular, this reel was an AWG of 26, which is appropriate for crimping

                  Seth found a SN-28B crimper in the lab, so I no longer need to go to the ECE

                <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm still continuing to work on this, but I've crimped up the data and address
                ribbon cables. I learned how to properly use a Dupont crimping tool from
                <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Dupont-Crimp-Tool-Tutorial/">this tutorial</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Since this project requires the prototyping of our bus interface, the ribbon cable
                is a good way to jump all those signals onto a breadboard that we can connect and
                probe. In that way, it contributes to the project that facilitating the
                prototyping process.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I need to create the ribbon cable for the twenty (20) bus control signals.
                </li>
                <li>

                Today, I brought my old ECE 362 breadboard in from my apartment, and will work on
                transferring the setup currently on the other breadboard to the new one.

                </li>
                <li>
                  I removed all the components from this breadboard, organized the parts back into
                  my Mini Kit, and set up new jumpers between all the power rails.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then, at the top of the breadboard, I laid down foam tape and double-sided
                  scotch tape to act as a mounting surface for the carrier boards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, I placed the carrier boards on the tape layers, and secured them with a
                  couple tacks of hot glue near the mounting holes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I then wired up the SWD setup that we had previously. I also included 2 slide
                  switches to be able to switch the <code>SWCLK</code> and
                  <code>SWDIO</code> signals between the two carrier boards, such that we can use
                  one Pico debug probe to debug both stamps.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Here's the newly assembled breadboard. I'm confident that the spring connectors in
                my own breadboard are a lot more reliable, so this should be more usable for
                prototyping and wiring all those signals.

              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we have a reliable breadboard, I won't second guess whether a jumper
                cable on the breadboard is actually making a good connection/circuit. With better
                peace of mind during prototyping, the rest of prototyping should be faster.

              <p>
                I decided to continue work on my own, and investigate the issue with the carrier
                board with vertical pins.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    First, I verified that I had the right carrier board (the one with the issue).
                    Yep, this is the one with the vertical-looking FlexyPins. Mounting stamps on
                    this is difficult, and some pins don't make proper contact.

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Here's what it looks like on the other carrier board, which I think is more
                    correct. I also took the opportunity to modify the stamp so that it had 2
                    header pins on it, such that I could use normal jumper wires, instead of
                    having to use the custom probing cables I made last time.
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    I went ahead and desoldered each FlexyPin individually, so here is the board
                    with all of the pins removed.

                  <p>
                    I tried to reinstall FlexyPins that did not have this issue, but the solder
                    from the previous job had filled the vias, and I couldn't effectively extract
                    the solder from the holes. Therefore, I decided to solder this stamp directly
                    to the carrier board using the castellated pad edges.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              </div>
              <p>
                I tested the newly amended carrier board, and it now works against the Serial Wire
                Debug (SWD) setup. After some reworking of the other solder connections, I think
                the board is ready to use. I learned about a lot of desoldering techniques, and
                also other techniques to try to remove solder from vias, though the latter was
                ultimately unsuccessful.

              </p>
              <p>
                Now that the second carrier board is ready for action, we can now use both boards
                for prototyping, which is important, since so much of our project hinges on the
                communication between boards.

              <p>
                Seth asked me to come into lab today to help with an issue that he was having;
                namely, he was trying to get Serial Wire Debug (SWD) working on the stamps, such
                that each stamp could be programmed without needing to press the board's reset
                button, and also allow for setting breakpoints and line stepping debugging
                commands.
              </p>
              <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
              <p>I did two main things:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Acting as a
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">"rubber ducky"</a>
                  debugging assistant for Seth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Did some hardware work to build out Seth's testing setup onto a breadboard; into
                  something that could be further expanded into a larger prototype.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>More specifically:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Seth explained that any Raspberry Pi Pico could be turned into an SWD debugging
                  probe, by loading the
                  <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe"><code>debugprobe</code>
                    firmware</a>
                  onto it. This Pico probe can then be wired into the target board's SWD port,
                  where it would supposedly "just work"
                </li>
                <li>
                  In particular, the instructions we were following were "Appendix A: Debugprobe"
                  of the
                  <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf">Getting
                    Started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series</a>
                  manual
                </li>
                <li>
                  We tried to connect the bench oscilloscope to the <code>SWCLK</code> and
                  <code>SWDIO</code> lines on the board, but when attemping to communicate with
                  the board using both of the tools that we tried (the Raspberry Pi fork of
                  <code>openocd</code>, and <code>probe-rs</code>), the probe was unable to
                  communicate, and the oscilloscope signals remained steady.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I suspected that one potential issue with the setup was that the setup wasn't
                  stable enough for SWD (the current test setup were two boards on the table, with
                  two jumpers from the Pico jammed into the SWD holes on the carrier board. The
                  reason we did not use a connector is because the carrier board only exposes SWD
                  via a small JST connector, which we did not have on hand).
                </li>
                <li>
                  To try to rectify this, I tried to do two things:
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                      <p>
                        I dug through the spare table box to find a pair of Dupont cables, and a
                        pair of probes, which I then spliced together into a pair of single
                        cables. Instead of jamming the male Duponts directly into the header
                        vias,
                        I instead used these new cables to to hook onto the FlexyPins, hopefully
                        providing a more secure connection.

                      <p>
                        I dug through the breadboard box, and found a breadboard, where I added
                        foam tape as a base layer, double sided table on top of that, and added
                        hot glue in small spots to attach each dev board into the breadboard, so
                        we can move every dev board together all as one. Then, I replicated the
                        debug circuit on this new setup.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This new setup did not work either. We ran into the same no communication
                    errors, and the same flatline on the oscilloscope as we did earlier.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  After some more time debugging, and reading the Getting Started manual, Seth
                  realized that we had been connecting the SWD of the Pico with the SWD of the
                  stamp, where in reality on a closer reading, we should be connecting
                  <code>GP2</code> and <code>GP3</code>. Upon some fiddling, the debugger started
                  to work, and we could flash programs via SWD.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                We got Serial Wire Debug (SWD) working by using a Raspberry Pi Pico as a debug
                probe, and were able to program a Stamp XL using it. I learned about specifics of
                SWD, debugging with a "Pico Probe", and to pay attention to the manual.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                By getting SWD working, we can more quickly iterate on programs for the RP2350,
                because we don't need to reach over and press the reset button to program each
                Stamp. This also allows for us to program in automated testing suites.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I'd like to bring over my own breadboard from ECE 362 to replace this
                  breadboard, since the contacts appear to have been worn out (continuity did not
                  pass on certain lines on the breadboard, so we had to switch to different parts
                  of it)
                </li>
                <li>
                  I'd like to set up a wiring harness between the two breadboards, so that the two
                  Stamp XLs can directly communicate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I still need to investigate the issue with the vertical looking pins on one of
                  the stamp carriers. When testing som of its pins of continuity, they did not
                  pass. So, we could not use this carrier for SWD, and had to use the other one.

              <p><strong>What did you work on?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Two of our RP2350B
                <a href="https://www.solder.party/docs/rp2350-stamp-xl/">Stamp XLs</a> and their
                <a href="https://www.solder.party/docs/rp2xxx-stamp-carrier-xl/">respective carrier
                  boards</a>
                arrived yesterday, but they're not assembled. The header pins, and mounting method
                are not soldered on. I will be working on putting these boards together, since
                they're crucial for communication bus prototyping.
              </p>

              <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>
              <p>
                In addition to the stamps and their carrier boards, we also ordered two (2) bags
                of one hundred (100)
                <a href="https://www.solder.party/docs/flexypin/">FlexyPins</a>, which should
                allow us to place or remove the stamps on the board. Seth was also in the lab that
                day, so I worked with him to install the FlexyPins onto the board, which need to
                be inserted one-by-one.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then went ahead and soldered down the FlexyPins for each carrier board. Then the
                "Arduino Mega" style female pin headers, then the extra pin headers, then the DC
                barrel plug. Nathan was also there, and he helped to solder the header pins on one
                of the boards.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, I did a test fit of the Stamp XL boards on their carrier boards.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
              </p>
              <div class="image-section">
                <img src="Team/journal/img - member1/week6/phone1.png"
                  alt="two assembled stamp carrier boards with stamp XLs on them" height="600" />
              </div>
              <p>The two boards are fully assembled!</p>
              <p>
                One of the stamp carriers had a greater angle to its FlexyPins, while the other's
                FlexyPins appeared to stand straight up. For the one with the pins that appeared
                to have an angle (about 45 degrees), the Stamp XL fit easily and snugly in the
                carrier. It was more difficult to attach the Stamp XL to the other carrier board.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the Stamp XLs are the only dev boards that expose all 48 GPIO pins on the
                RP2350B, being able to use them is crucial if we want to be able to create a
                prototype of our (fairly wide bus). Putting the dev boards (carrier boards)
                together is another step towards that.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We need to put these boards together into a development setup, such that their
                  GPIO pins are connected together so they can communicate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I'd like to check up the carrier board that has the vertical-ish pins, to see if
                  there are any continuity issues.

                I worked on transposing my journal from Discord over to the journal website. I
                also started writing functional descriptions for our boards (to be used in PSDRs).

              <p>
                I mostly copy over my Discord notes with their relevant timestamps, and then
                add/modify an additional mini summary of what happened in that entry to be more
                clear.

                That this journal transposing process takes way too long, we need to find some

                Seth and I came up with a plan to transition all of our team journals over to

                  the backplane is responsible for converting some unregulated voltage source into
                  3.3V power, which can then be distributed to the rest of the system
                </li>
                <li>
                  let's lock this in, let's take 5V 3A power from a USB-C port on the back of the
                  backplane board, which we then need to distribute throughout the backplane
                </li>
                <li>
                  remark: we may need multiple voltage regulator blocks throughout the backplane,
                  because of the distance that power and signals will need to traverse (we'd like
                  to step 5V to 3.3V as close to the module connector as possible, but this is
                  mutually exclusive from having multiple module connectors. the solution?
                  multiple voltage regulators across the backplane)

                  since we have so many UI elements (more than 20 switches and LEDs each), the

                I need to formalize our PSDRs and write detailed functional descriptions of each

                i'm most interested in seeing how this validates my priors, and also this should
                pave the way to PCB design, where we can validate the height of the DIMM

              <p>things to review:</p>

                  where USB is plugged in while entire device is under external [other] power
                  source..)
                </li>
                <li>
                  check edge board substrate thickness, pitch, etc.... is it easy to route? can we
                  fit the jumper vias with the current pitch? swap from DDR4?
                </li>
                <li>find proper JST connector for GPIO pins 0-3</li>
              </ul>
              <p>remarks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  check errata... do we need bias on GPIO40-GPIO47 due to weak/faulty internal
                  tri-state?
                </li>
                <li>reel supply of RP2350A/B not reliable, look for options</li>
                <li>
                  4.7u guidance assumes pin 32 is far away from voltage regulation... check this
                  assertion later
                </li>
                <li>consider making the 12 latter jumpers have copper trace defaults</li>

                  DIMMs have a weird outline (for insertion/rocking reasons, whatever), but will

                </li>
                <li>
                  likely easier to make a sketch in a CAD tool and import the generated DXF solve

                  remark: i thought there would ne 288 available signals on a DIMM, but it seems

                  address signals, 8 data signals, totaling 92 signals). this might be too much

                I made a good first pass on the schematic, setting up all the decoupling caps, the

              <p>
                For writing up of the MCP23017 I/O expanders, I referenced

              </p>
              <p>
                The core of the schematic is done! I learned a lot about the specifics of
                designing with the RP2350B, since I've only designed boards for the STM32F0 series
                previously.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a big step to getting the schematic completely finished! A good stepping
                stone to that juicy PCB layout.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I need to recheck all the remarks I made, the voltage regulators handling if the
                other side isn't passive, recheck edge board constraints, find proper connectors
                (for UART), check the GPIO40-47 errata, check the chip supply, check the 4.7u
                capacitor placement guidance, try making the solder jumpers have defaults. I also
                need to add connectors to the schematic, and I may need to make a custom symbol
                for our edge connector.

              <p>
                I made a sketch to get a rough idea of what size and layout I want the card PCB
                DIMM to have. I made some part selections for our schematic, based on the
                RP2350B's reference hardware design. Additionally, I also made some design
                decisions, such as including solder jumpers, and allowing for a second I/O
                expander to be populated, to increase our I/O flexibility, and allow for the same
                board design to be used for different purposes.

              <p><strong>How did you work on it?</strong></p>

                I finalized some additional design decisions related to part selection and solder
                jumpers, and learned about some specifics to hardware design with the RP2350B,
                since I've only designed boards for the STM32F0 series previously.

              <p><strong>What did you work on?</strong></p>
              <p>
                I finalized work on our initial pin mappings (what specific function we assign to
                each of the RP2350's 48 GPIO pins).

              <p>
                I cross-referenced against older notes I made, and continued to make use of the
                8800's
                <a href="https://vtda.org/docs/computing/MITS/MITS_Altair8800TheoryOperation_1975.pdf">Theory

              </p>
              <p>
                All of our initial pin mappings are done, and now I have a clearer idea about
                which processor status lines are critical for real time operation, and which
                status lines are really only useful for the front panel.

              </p>
              <p>
                Now that the pin mapping are done, I can go forward and set up the schematic for
                the card, which is the hardware design that I'd like to start with. Making the
                schematic for the card will also help with the schematics of the front panel
                board, which also needs a RP2350B chip.

                <strong>What was the result and what did you learn from it?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We made some additional changes (like dropping the VI lines), and I learned about
                the role of the 8259 in a more general MCS-80 system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How did this contribute to the project progress?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to progress on creating the schematic for any of the boards, we need to
                get our communication bus defined. This pin research helps finalize some of that.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What are the next steps that must be taken?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to finish up the initial bus pin mapping, such that we can get to the
                schematic, and eventually PCB design.

                  Setsuna recommended looking into tri-state buffers or GPIO expanders to offload

                <li>Maybe can fulfill some 8212 logic? Or add back multimaster support</li>
                <li>
                  GPIO expanders might be useful for less time critical signals... check those
                  (RESET?? certain S lines? P lines?)

                <li>MCP23017/MCP23S17 for I2C line config?</li>
                <li>I think most front panel signals have the fewest issues with this</li>
                <li>Just need to make sure that those lines will not be used by e.g. memory</li>
                <li>
                  Remark: Need to figure out the bus timing information + reset control timing
                  information (this will also be useful during A3, we need a state machine diagram
                  for different parts of the timing cycle [each different piece of software])
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alternative, use the SPI flavor, and use two of these to free up address/data
                  lines
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notably... 10 MHz 1-bit SPI cannot keep up with 2 MHz 16-bit parallel bus I
                  don't think... timing information investigation should help determine good fit

                  then set up notional 2350B package pin mappings (we want some sort of remaining

                  Two options: Drop more lines, explore physical jumper setting of modes, or

                  Random musing: WordStar I think has a version that ran on CP/M before getting

                  Might be worth seeing, if we ever get CP/M running, if WordStar would be

                Big fan on how MITS defines 8 separate "Vectored Interrupt Control Lines" and then
                proceeds to OR them all together into the 8080's one interrupt control pin

              <p>
                Remark: The real vectored interrupt priority was the DIP switches we put on the

                  the RP2350B has 48 GPIO pins available, with the current layout, we're using
                  37/48 GPIO pin allocations
                </li>
                <li>
                  have about 11 more signals to allocation (really iffy on whether we'll have
                  enough signals on the CPU card)
                </li>
                <li>most likely that we will not have mutli-master support, this is fine</li>
                <li>NOTE, need an additional column of Intel 8212 I/O peripheral support pins</li>
                <li>
                  i think the 8212 is mostly there to latch I/O signals (provided by from #D pins,
                  once) when starting I/O operations
