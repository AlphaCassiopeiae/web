This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brightspace.  

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

    <h2>===============   Week 2: =================</h2>
			
	<!--  Week 2, Entry 2  -->
	<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: January 24th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 9:30am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 1.5 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
			<p>I discussed with brian how our computer would load programs</p>
			<p>I learned that the front panel is basically useless because it doesn't allow for easy program input while the computer is running and is mostly for just programming the bootstrapper for the microsoft basic OS you were going to load into memory. Then all programming was done via the os on a monitor connected over the uart. could be teletype, etc. </p>
			<p>So our computer is not that useful without uart and although it is a stretch goal it is one I want to achieve.</p>
			<p>We would want to connect our computer over uart and open a serial console to interface with it.</p>
			<p>I also determined with the team that we are going full rust and not programming the 8080 with C. Based on this rust implementation of the 8080 it's not that much to establish the data structures to get the state machines for the processor. I was concerned that because rust has a high learning curve and Caleb who was working on the software with me might struggle, however we believe we have enough time to learn rust and program the 8080 emulator in the semester.</p>

			
	<!--  Week 2, Entry 1  -->
	<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: January 22th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 9:30am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 2.5 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
            <p>Today I went through the <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf">RP2350 datasheet</a> today (1.5 hours). Learned about how programmable i/o works using ChatGPT (what we're going to use for our bus) and why we're choosing it for our microcontroller vs. others (dicussed with brian).</p>
			<p>I attended project discussion/group meeting (0.5 hours)</p>
			<p>Looked through the code of the <a href="https://github.com/cbiffle/rs80">Rust 8080 emulator repository</a> we were looking at that was similar to what we wanted to implement. Determined that we could use this as a test suite to check our hardware if we don't finish our own emulator before.</p>

	<h4><b>Entry 2: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: January 17th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 9:30am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 2 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
			<p>I wrote the functional description on the a1 doc as well as drafted the budget</p>
			<p>I made and reviewed project milestones with the team</p>
			<p>I uploaded bio to website and functional description</p>
			
	<!--  Week 1, Entry 1  -->
	<h4><b>Entry 1: -----------------------------------------------------------------</b></h4>
           <b>Date: January 15th </b><br> <!--the date the project meeting or work was performed)-->
            <b>Start Time: 8:00am </b><br> <!--the time you began the meeting/work for this entry-->
            <b>Duration: 3.5 hours </b><br><br> <!--how long the meeting/work lasted rounded to nearest quarter hour-->
            <p>Before lab I learned about the s100 bus today, researched the 8080 instruction set, and watch some altair 8080 programming videos</p>
			<p>Then in lab we learned about the lab resources and introduced our team</p>
			<p>I then discussed with brian and team what case we want (extruded aluminum) where the pcb slides in on one of the ledges. What box we choose determines our PCB size</p>
			<p>Then we discussed what project management software. microsoft planner, notion, github issues?</p>
			<p>I got the Github org setup with the name Alpha Cassiopeiae</p>
